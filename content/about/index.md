Primary Unit is written by me, Rob Wells, as a personal blog. I’m currently studying for an MSc in [computer science at Birkbeck College][bbk] at night, and work for [a peace campaign][cnd] during the day. I used to work for [a newspaper][star]. You can subscribe to my posts by [RSS][] or [JSON][].

If you’d like to get in touch, send an email to my first name at robjwells.com.

You can find my code at [GitHub][] and bookmarks at [Pinboard][]. *Very occasionally* I put photos on [Flickr][].
