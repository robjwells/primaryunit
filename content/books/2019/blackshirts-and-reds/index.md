Parenti starts with a look at how fascism serves the interests of capital, follows with a clear-eyed defence of communism and communist states ([here’s a short video summary of his position][parenti-communism-works]), and spells out the disaster wrought by the restoration of capitalism in eastern Europe.

It’s well worth reading, and I’d highly recommend it to anyone drawn to left politics or curious about the Soviet Union.
