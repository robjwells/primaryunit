Code is easily one of my favourite books.
It builds up a computer from simple pieces, and the journey is very fun.
I first read it in 2013, and re-read it this year during my computer architecture & operating systems module.
I will happily talk your ear off about how great it is, but youâ€™re probably better served by reading the book itself.
