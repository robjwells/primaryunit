The TV series is phenomenal, but it’s fictionalised to make for gripping viewing.
John Douglas is the “real” Holden Ford, and his book details how the profiling programme got going and how it worked, and digs into more of the detail of profiling than you get in the show.
There’s a good deal of colour and, strange enough given the horrific crimes, personal warmth in the book.
Very interesting and readable.
