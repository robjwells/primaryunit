I read most of this in 2018 and finished it off in the first week of January.
I’d had it for a while but picked it up after watching the Mexico season of Narcos (which, as with previous seasons, unsurprisingly treats the DEA very softly), and I raced through it.
The depth of the collusion between the state and the cartels is astonishing.
Hernández’s revelations will force you to seriously think about what’s really going on when you hear of wars between the gangs.
