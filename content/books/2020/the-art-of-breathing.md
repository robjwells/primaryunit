This is a beautiful, short introduction to mindfulness meditation.
It’s poetic and a bit whimsical, done with a very gentle touch.
It covers the essentials, and there are [a set of guided meditations on Penman’s website][audio] for you to follow along with.

I think it would serve well as a first introduction to mindfulness meditation for a general audience, by which I mean anyone not put off by the title, which is entirely fair for the content of the book. (And which is fine! But I feel the more, er, straightforward-inclined might be deterred — the shoebox part for instance.)

Penman was co-author with Mark Williams on [Mindfulness: Finding Peace in a Frantic World][mindfulness], and I wonder if that’s more down to earth.
(I have a copy but haven’t read it yet. It’s a similar length to [The Mindful Way through Depression][depression], which Williams co-authored previously, which is very good, gentle but straightforward.)

There’s also a weird thing about Marx and Engels on p86, where Penman uses the “[all that is solid melts into air][cm]” phrase from the [Communist Manifesto][cm], and follows with:

> Apologies to Marx and Engels (they’d probably think meditation is a ‘capitalist running-dog conspiracy’. It isn’t, in case you were wondering.)

As far as I can tell, “capitalist running-dog conspiracy” is not a phrase ever used by Marx or Engels, but it’s just so strange to include this weird slight in, of all things, a book about meditation.

They wrote [basically nothing about Buddhism][me-bud], from which secular mindfulness techniques are drawn.
But their work was substantially about connections and circulations within society, the links between different social and economic forces.
They were open to and eager for scientific discovery and advancement.
How strange would it be to consider that they might not just blithely write off a technique all about the connection between mind and body when there is increasing — and increasingly critiqued and scrutinised — [evidence about its effects][science]?

(There is, of course, the [“McMindfulness” debate][criticism], which argues more or less that, divorced from Buddhist ethics, it is being used as a substitute for addressing societal problems and a source of profit.
Frankly if you ever thought that there was a possibility of challenging capitalism through mindfulness I know [two dead Germans][me] who’d like to have a word.)

I get that it’s odd to write four paragraphs about *one short line* half-way through, but it did jump out at me. Maybe it’s just another sign of the pervasive, mindless anti-communism of our culture.

Anyway, this is a fine, beautiful book that I won’t be recommending to my hard-nosed humourless conspiratorial Marxist friends but may lend to those with more poetic inclinations.
