This is a beautiful, short introduction to mindfulness meditation.
It’s poetic and a bit whimsical, done with a very gentle touch.
It covers the essentials, and there are [a set of guided meditations on Penman’s website][audio] for you to follow along with.

I think it would serve well as a first introduction to mindfulness meditation for a general audience, by which I mean anyone not put off by the title, which is entirely fair for the content of the book. (And which is fine! But I feel the more, er, straightforward-inclined might be deterred — the shoebox part for instance.)

Penman was co-author with Mark Williams on [Mindfulness: Finding Peace in a Frantic World][mindfulness], and I wonder if that’s more down to earth.
(I have a copy but haven’t read it yet. It’s a similar length to [The Mindful Way through Depression][depression], which Williams co-authored previously, which is very good, gentle but straightforward.)

There’s also a weird thing about Marx and Engels on p86, where Penman uses the “[all that is solid melts into air][cm]” phrase from the [Communist Manifesto][cm], and follows with:

> Apologies to Marx and Engels (they’d probably think meditation is a ‘capitalist running-dog conspiracy’. It isn’t, in case you were wondering.)

Previously, I’d written more about how this was wrong-headed given Marx and Engels’s openness to scientific discovery (and the “running-dog” phrase is not even one of theirs).
I ditched that because, on reflection, it came across as unkind.
This throwaway line I think is just a reflection of the deep anti-communist trend in Britain’s modern mainstream intellectual culture.
(I do think it’s particularly *mindless* of Penman to include it, and odd enough that it’s sparked me to write this!)
