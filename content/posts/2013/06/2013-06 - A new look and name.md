I thought it was time for a change on this blog, as I’ve never been particularly happy it and have lost count of the number of major changes it has been through.

The domain’s been mine since 2008 or 2009, the back-end has been switched at least five times between Blogger, WordPress and Tumblr, and there are so few posts — and none from before last year — because almost all were crap and I didn’t want my name associated with them.

It is fair to say that robjwells.com has not had an easy life so far, aside from being left alone most of the time.

But I have spent a lot of time thinking about what I want this blog to be and an even longer time making a design that I am happy with.

I had always wanted to change the design to something of my own because despite trying plenty of themes there was always *something* that annoyed me.

However, I was reluctant to put in the time if I was just going to neglect the blog or fill it with the same rubbish I’d spent five years being embarrassed by.

Things changed after I started reading [Dr Drang’s blog][drang] this year. He’s prolific and writes interesting posts about all kinds of stuff. I often search his site for ideas or as a reference on computer topics.

Over the weekend I spent a while looking at his earliest entries — from eight years ago! The amount of effort and thought he had put in was clear and over time it must have stuck.

(What a revelation! I’m sure there’s an equally revelatory Malcolm Gladwell book about it or something.)

Good work takes hard work and, with that in mind, I’m going to have another crack at this thing. In a bid to break with the past I’ve also given it a proper name after years of suffering as “Rob’s blog”.
