Oh Claudio. Oh mate. I know, we’ve all been there pet. You’ve got your head down, working hard, but still, “[everything is wrong][cr].”

You just want to pull the duvet over your head and just hope it goes away. But when “everything is wrong” the best bet is often to take a good look.

Shall we? Let’s.

Claudio, mate, I know you want to prove that [old Nige][np] isn’t the only one who can summon a Christmas miracle for the Foxes, but this is a little too close for comfort.

I really was joking [last time][lcfc-2016-5], there was no need to kick off a 2014-15 tribute band.

Good news, though; let’s think positive. We are more or less on trend for safety:

But that’s not exactly what I’d call [sustainable safety][] (*ahem*). As ever those flat periods representing losses are misleading, giving the impression that you’re treading water when you’re really sinking below the surface. Reorienting the plot around the safety line gives a more realistic view:

That’s a lot of losses, occasionally topped up with wins. There aren't many draws in there, and there need to be more of them. The safety trend line is only just over 1 point per match. Keeping up with it by losing two and winning one has an obvious flaw: if you’re losing most of the time it’s unlikely you’ll bag the wins you need. Fighting out for draws and a single point means you can chip away at that total and hopefully spare yourself the need for any heroics.

After last season, boring conservative play is a come down, but we all know what the other option is.
