I added support for [JSON Feed][] to my homemade static site generator [Majestic][] today, and thought I’d note it because funnily enough the two implementations [mentioned by John Gruber][df] (by [Niclas Darville][nd] and [Jason McIntosh][jm]) used the approach I’d taken for [generating my RSS feed][rss-template] and wanted to avoid.

[JSON Feed]: https://jsonfeed.org
[Majestic]: https://github.com/robjwells/majestic
[df]: https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/19/json-feed-jekyll
[nd]:https://github.com/hafniatimes/hafniatimes.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/jsonfeed.html
[jm]: https://github.com/jmacdotorg/plerd/blob/master/templates/jsonfeed.tt
[rss-template]: https://github.com/robjwells/majestic/blob/master/majestic/default_templates/majestic-rss.xml

Basically all three of those define a document template and pass in the posts and other required bits, and you’re done. I’m really not knocking this — again, I do this with the RSS feed and it validates fine. It’s all good.

But I ended up templating my RSS feed like this because I looked at the [feedgenerator][fg] module and ran away. Majestic was my first Python project of any real size and I wanted to keep things as straightforward as I could. While it looks (with hindsight) [reasonably OK in use][pelican-feed], it doesn’t have any documentation, has been pulled out of Django, and has funky class names (`Rss201rev2Feed`) that didn’t fill me with confidence that I could implement an RSS feed quickly.

[fg]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedgenerator/1.9
[pelican-feed]: https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/blob/master/pelican/writers.py

I was using [Jinja][] templating for the site and since HTML and XML are cousins just did that. But you can probably tell that I didn’t really know what I’m doing (still don’t!) with escaping as any field that might contain non-Ascii characters is wrapped in `<![CDATA[…]]>` tags.

But hey, it works. Feed’s valid.

With JSON, everything just feels much more obvious. In Python you hand off basic types to the built-in [json][pjson] module and you get back a string, all the encoding taken care of. And if I make a mistake Python will complain at me, instead of just dumping out a file of questionable worth.

[pjson]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html

I think this is what all the people complaining on the Hacker News thread missed. Working in JSON is comfortable and familiar — the tools are good and you get told when something goes wrong. Working with XML can be unclear and a bit of a pain, and creating an invalid document is a risk.

So my super-duper advanced JSON Feed implementation is… constructing a `dict`, adding things to it and passing it off to the json module that I use *all the time*. Taken care of. The code’s so boring I’m not even going to include it here (but [it’s online to view][majestic-jsonfeed]).
