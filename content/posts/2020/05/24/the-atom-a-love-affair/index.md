I watched [The Atom: A Love Affair][web] last night, a new documentary about the history of nuclear power, and it’s really great. It charts the ups and downs of nuclear power, its promoters and opponents, and looks at where we are today. I think its great strength is that it sets out the surrounding context. It doesn’t take a side but gives a fair accounting (which [I think leads to a clear conclusion][cnd], though I would, wouldn’t I?).

You can [stream it online at Curzon Home Cinema][curzon], and I highly recommend it.

There’s [a Q&A session held after the film’s premiere][yt], and more info on [the Facebook page][fb]. There’s also [an episode of Radio 3’s Sound of Cinema with the film’s composer Paul Honey][radio3].
