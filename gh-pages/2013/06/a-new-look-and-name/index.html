    <p>I thought it was time for a change on this blog, as I’ve never been particularly happy it and have lost count of the number of major changes it has been through.</p>
<p>The domain’s been mine since 2008 or 2009, the back-end has been switched at least five times between Blogger, WordPress and Tumblr, and there are so few posts — and none from before last year — because almost all were crap and I didn’t want my name associated with them.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that robjwells.com has not had an easy life so far, aside from being left alone most of the time.</p>
<p>But I have spent a lot of time thinking about what I want this blog to be and an even longer time making a design that I am happy with.</p>
<p>I had always wanted to change the design to something of my own because despite trying plenty of themes there was always <em>something</em> that annoyed me.</p>
<p>However, I was reluctant to put in the time if I was just going to neglect the blog or fill it with the same rubbish I’d spent five years being embarrassed by.</p>
<p>Things changed after I started reading <a href="http://leancrew.com/">Dr Drang’s blog</a> this year. He’s prolific and writes interesting posts about all kinds of stuff. I often search his site for ideas or as a reference on computer topics.</p>
<p>Over the weekend I spent a while looking at his earliest entries — from eight years ago! The amount of effort and thought he had put in was clear and over time it must have stuck.</p>
<p>(What a revelation! I’m sure there’s an equally revelatory Malcolm Gladwell book about it or something.)</p>
<p>Good work takes hard work and, with that in mind, I’m going to have another crack at this thing. In a bid to break with the past I’ve also given it a proper name after years of suffering as “Rob’s blog”.</p>
