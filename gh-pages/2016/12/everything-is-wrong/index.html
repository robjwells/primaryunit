    <p>Oh Claudio. Oh mate. I know, we’ve all been there pet. You’ve got your head down, working hard, but still, “<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38197572">everything is wrong</a>.”</p>
<p>You just want to pull the duvet over your head and just hope it goes away. But when “everything is wrong” the best bet is often to take a good look.</p>
<p>Shall we? Let’s.</p>
<p class="full-width">
    <a href="/images/2016-17_lcfc-first_15_games.svg">
        <img alt="A chart showing Leicester City’s points in the first 15 games, 2014-15 to 2016-17 seasons"
             src="/images/2016-17_lcfc-first_15_games.svg"
             class="no-border">
    </a>
</p>

<p>Claudio, mate, I know you want to prove that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Pearson">old Nige</a> isn’t the only one who can summon a Christmas miracle for the Foxes, but this is a little too close for comfort.</p>
<p>I really was joking <a href="/2016/09/leicesters-start-to-the-season/">last time</a>, there was no need to kick off a 2014-15 tribute band.</p>
<p>Good news, though; let’s think positive. We are more or less on trend for safety:</p>
<p class="full-width">
    <a href="/images/2016-12-10_lcfc-points_over_time.svg">
        <img alt="A chart showing Leicester City’s points over time in the 2014-15 to 2016-17 seasons as of 2016-12-10"
             src="/images/2016-12-10_lcfc-points_over_time.svg"
             class="no-border">
    </a>
</p>

<p>But that’s not exactly what I’d call <a href="https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/sustainable-safety/">sustainable safety</a> (<em>ahem</em>). As ever those flat periods representing losses are misleading, giving the impression that you’re treading water when you’re really sinking below the surface. Reorienting the plot around the safety line gives a more realistic view:</p>
<p class="full-width">
    <a href="/images/2016-12-10_lcfc-points_adrift.svg">
        <img alt="A chart showing Leicester City’s distance from the safety trend, 2014-15 to 2016-17 seasons as of 2016-12-10"
             src="/images/2016-12-10_lcfc-points_adrift.svg"
             class="no-border">
    </a>
</p>

<p>That’s a lot of losses, occasionally topped up with wins. There aren't many draws in there, and there need to be more of them. The safety trend line is only just over 1 point per match. Keeping up with it by losing two and winning one has an obvious flaw: if you’re losing most of the time it’s unlikely you’ll bag the wins you need. Fighting out for draws and a single point means you can chip away at that total and hopefully spare yourself the need for any heroics.</p>
<p>After last season, boring conservative play is a come down, but we all know what the other option is.</p>
