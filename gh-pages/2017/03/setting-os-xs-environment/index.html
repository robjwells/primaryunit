  <p><strong>Warning: The contents of this post may not be up to date!</strong></p>
  <p>Sorry, but if you’re searching for answers about why you can’t reliably set environment variables in OS X (particularly <code>PATH</code>), the information below may be out of date.</p>
  <p>Apple has changed the system so many times in so many different ways it’s difficult to find <em>anything</em> on the internet about this that is correct and up-to-date, so I’ve placed this warning on the top of every post I’ve written about it.</p>
  <p>As of 2017-03-02 it appears that the best collection of information is <a href="https://github.com/ersiner/osx-env-sync">the osx-env-sync project on GitHub</a> and its associated issues.</p>
  <p>Be wary of anything that you find on StackOverflow: the answers there may well have been correct at the time but incorrect now.</p>
  <p>For reference, my own posts on this problem (newest first) are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/2017/03/setting-os-xs-environment/">Setting OS X’s environment</a></li>
    <li><a href="/2014/12/locale-in-os-x-whats-the-current-situation/">Locale in OS X — what’s the current situation?</a></li>
    <li><a href="/2014/12/locale-in-os-x-and-launch-agents/">Locale in OS X and Launch Agents</a></li>
    <li><a href="/2013/09/get-your-us-ascii-out-of-my-face/">Get your US-ASCII out of my face</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Trying to set a consistent environment in OS X is the single most frustrating thing I’ve ever tried to do on a Mac.</p>
<p>I’ve written three posts (<a href="/2013/09/get-your-us-ascii-out-of-my-face/">1</a>, <a href="/2014/12/locale-in-os-x-and-launch-agents/">2</a>, <a href="/2014/12/locale-in-os-x-whats-the-current-situation/">3</a>) in the past few years trying to get to the bottom of this but <em>still</em> I have problems. (That’s why that giant disclaimer is on the top of this post!)</p>
<p>This bit me again the other day when using a Jupyter notebook to <a href="/2017/03/textexpander-to-launchbar-snippets/">export from TextExpander</a>, with my favourite UnicodeDecodeError. Here’s an example:</p>
<pre><code>-----------------------------------------------------------------
UnicodeEncodeError              Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-8-c4b3c1d6f2e6&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
      1 with open('/Users/robjwells/Desktop/testfile', 'w') as f:
----&gt; 2     f.write('☃')

UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character
'\u2603' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)</code></pre>


<p>Now, this machine has been upgraded all the way from 10.7 and my understanding is that if you’ve a fresh install of a more recent version then you should be OK as far as the encoding-related environment variables (<code>LANG</code>, <code>LC_CTYPE</code>, <code>LC_ALL</code>). <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0538/#background">A recent Python enhancement proposal</a> includes the paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Apple platforms (including both Mac OS X and iOS), this [ensuring Python is set to use UTF-8] is straightforward, as Apple guarantees that these [Python start-up] operations will always use UTF-8 to do the conversion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’ve ready my posts linked above, particularly <a href="/2014/12/locale-in-os-x-and-launch-agents/">Locale in OS X and Launch Agents</a>, a good question arises: “I thought you’d figured this out!”</p>
<p>Well, yeah, me too! I have a script that runs at start-up designed to set my environment up. But it’s not reliable — I think because it may run after other start-up items (both Launch Agents &amp; Daemons, and the Login Items listed in System Preferences). One of those is my Jupyter notebook server, hence the problem above.</p>
<p>Having the environment script run as the root user doesn’t solve the problem — in fact it means it has no effect at all.</p>
<p>(My way of checking whether a program has inherited my script-set environment variables is to define <code>RJWENVSET</code> as well.)</p>
<p>And then there’s the <code>PATH</code>, which I used to set in the same script using <code>launchctl setenv</code> like my other environment variables. Which doesn’t work. There’s a suggestion on <a href="https://github.com/ersiner/osx-env-sync/issues/1#issuecomment-230053839">a GitHub issue for a tool meant to resolve this problem</a> that the following command could reliably set the path:</p>
<pre><code>sudo launchctl config user path $PATH</code></pre>


<p>But that doesn’t work for me. You can swap <code>user</code> for <code>system</code> but I’m wary of doing that.</p>
<p>This problem is ludicrously frustrating. Apple deprecated /etc/launchd.conf “for security considerations” but it means there’s no reliable way of setting variables that will be inherited by your programs, and so no way of having a consistent environment.</p>
<p>What a pain in the arse.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have my environment.sh file set <code>LANG</code>, <code>LC_ALL</code>, <code>LC_CTYPE</code>, <code>PYTHONPATH</code>, <code>RJWENVSET</code> when it is run at start-up by <a href="https://www.peterborgapps.com/lingon/">Lingon</a> (for “all users”, though I’m not sure if this is any more effective than using “me” — I’m the only user on this machine).</li>
<li>My Lingon start-up items have environment variables and their <code>PATH</code> set explicitly.</li>
<li>I currently restart other start-up items that don’t pick up the variables set by environment.sh — but that doesn’t solve the <code>PATH</code> problem so you’ll want to <a href="http://leancrew.com/all-this/2017/03/the-keyboard-maestro-scripting-environment/">set that explicitly</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>But for Pete’s sake I wish I could just define variables in ~/.launchd.conf and be done with it.</p>
