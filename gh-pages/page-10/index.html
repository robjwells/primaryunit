      <p><time datetime="2016-09-07T01:30">Wednesday, September 7 2016</time></p>
    </header>
    <p>Some politicians intrigue me in a bizarre way, in that they are so shamelessly atrocious, so lacking in self-awareness. There are a few in the Labour Party, but I won’t say who as I’ve been told recently that if I offend the Compliance Unit my vote can be torn up despite me having cast it.</p>
<p>The man who has most recently attracted my attention is the new president of Brazil, Michel Temer, who has led the coup against Dilma Rousseff and the Workers Party (PT).</p>
<p>I’m not a big fan of Rousseff, nor the way the PT has conducted itself while in power. The situation it finds itself in now, I think, is a testament to its refusal under both Rousseff and Lula to confront centres of power. It shows the weaknesses of social democracy in contrast to socialism. If the PT had been more combative the coup likely would have still come, but perhaps more in the way that Venezuela has experienced.</p>
<p>But anyway, this isn’t about the PT! This is about Temer. Who is hilarious. (But not if you’re Brazilian!) Here’s a feature I wrote for work, which is <a href="http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-540e-Who-is-Michel-Temer">on the website</a> but presented here with links.</p>
<hr />
<p>After the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-37237513">ousting of democratically elected Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff</a> last week by a pack of corrupt senators the reins of power have fallen into the hands of the man who was her vice-president, Michel Temer.</p>
<p>Really it was only officially, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/dilma-rousseff-brazil-president-impeached-senate-vote">Temer had taken over Rousseff’s job in May</a> after Brazilian senators voted to begin impeachment proceedings and suspend the president in the meantime.</p>
<p>Thankfully he was well prepared. A month earlier, before even Brazil’s lower house of parliament had given a green light for impeachment, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-11/brazil-s-vp-practices-national-unity-speech-in-leaked-audio">a 15-minute recording was leaked</a> of Temer practising the first “address to the nation” he planned to give after Rousseff was out of the way.</p>
<p>In it, he says that he’s agonised over whether or not he should speak directly to the Brazilian people given the impeachment proceedings, despite being begged to, and that he wouldn’t dare appear to be taking the place of Rousseff while she waits to face the charges.</p>
<p>It sets the tone for Temer — who served six terms as an MP and is renowned as a behind-the-scenes deal-maker — and more generally the entire sordid affair.</p>
<p>There is good reason to think that Brazilians don’t care much for Temer’s thoughts. Brazil’s most-read, most-influential newspaper <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/07/21/folhas-journalistic-fraud-far-worse-than-we-reported-yesterday-a-smoking-gun-emerges/">Folha de Sao Paulo has just been caught out lying about and trying to cover up a poll</a> that it claimed said half of Brazilians want Temer to stay on. In reality almost two-thirds want him gone and new elections to be held.</p>
<p>As for “taking the place of the president,” it was only a week after Temer became acting president that he sprang <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/brazil-rightwing-government-michel-temer">a package of austerity measures</a> on the public that threaten to roll back the gains made under 13 years of Rousseff’s Workers Party (PT). On the list are the usual cuts and sell-offs, as well as a some novel moves such as weakening the definition of slavery.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Temer and his cabinet are rich white men in a nation mostly poor, black and female — many descended from the four million Africans kidnapped and shipped to Brazil as slaves.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why he was so loudly booed at the Rio Olympics opening ceremony — despite trying to hide from the crowd and insisting that he wasn’t introduced. (He avoided a repeat by not going to the closing ceremony.)</p>
<p>Now, Rousseff’s PT had adopted austerity measures following her re-election. The result has been to further weaken the economy while making Rousseff personally unpopular. But what Temer is suggesting — <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21698719-michel-temer-has-better-ideas-dilma-rousseff-does-not-mean-he-will-be-successful">reportedly planned out in a 18-page document last year</a> — is on another scale entirely.</p>
<p>Despite voters choosing Rousseff and the PT in October 2014, they now have a government headed by Temer’s PMDB — which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_general_election,_1994">hasn’t stood a presidential candidate in 20 years</a> — and supported by the PSDB, which has lost the last four presidential elections. The PT is shut out.</p>
<p>The PMDB is supposedly “centrist” and effectively defends entrenched elites.</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06SAOPAULO30_a.html">A US diplomatic cable</a> paraphrases Temer himself describing it to embassy staff as having “no real unifying national identity,” instead being “an umbrella organisation for regional bosses” who, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06SAOPAULO689_a.html">another cable states</a>, “for the most part seek political power for its own sake.”</p>
<p>The PMDB has proven flexible, going into coalition with both the neoliberal PSDB and then the PT — which itself, unfortunately, has proven flexible when it comes to challenging centres of economic power.</p>
<p>It appears that Temer and his pals finally snapped when an avalanche of corruption charges rained down on members of congress. Well over half of the 513-member lower house and 81-member senate <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-brazil-impeach-20160328-story.html">are being investigated</a> for serious crimes and corruption. These are the people who impeached Rousseff for using a routine budget mechanism that prosecutors have said is not a crime. (The PT only has 11 senators and 57 MPs.)</p>
<p>Temer himself is banned from standing for public office for eight years — even for his own job — for breaking election finance laws. He’s being investigated as part of the huge Operation Car Wash graft probe and has been accused of taking hundreds of thousands of pounds in bribes.</p>
<p>What better time, then, to stage a coup? Sweep those pesky corruption charges under the rug and seize power while you’re at it.</p>
<p>And it very much is a coup. Romero Juca, the head of Temer’s PMDB, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/05/23/new-political-earthquake-in-brazil-is-it-now-time-for-media-outlets-to-call-this-a-coup/">was caught on tape</a> saying that removing Rousseff was the only way to stop the Car Wash probe, and that he had the judges, media — uniformly anti-left — and military on board too.</p>
<p>“I am talking to the generals, the military commanders. They are fine with this, they said they will guarantee it,” Juca said.</p>
<p>With this in mind, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/new-brazilian-president-michel-temer-calls-for-profound-reflection/article30006592/">Temer’s call</a> for a government of “national salvation” to “pacify the nation” has more than just a sinister tinge, and raise fears that Brazilians could be in for a return to a very dark period in their country’s recent past.</p>

      <h2 class="mute-links"><a href="https://robjwells.github.io/2016/09/where-could-labours-votes-come-from/">Where could Labour’s votes come from?</a></h2>
      <p><time datetime="2016-09-02T14:30">Friday, September 2 2016</time></p>
    </header>
    <p>It was suggested often during last year’s Labour leadership contest that if the party had Jeremy Corbyn at the helm it couldn’t win a general election. The argument holds that Corbyn, as a leftwinger, couldn’t appeal to people who had previously voted for the Tories, and these were the people Labour needed to win over in order to make the sums work.</p>
<p>I considered writing about this at the time, but events overtook me and I left it alone as the argument faded. But it has recently been used by Corbyn’s opponent this year, Owen Smith.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s not just a question, as Jeremy said on a few occasions, [that] we need to get a few people who have contemplated voting Tory to vote Labour. We need to get two million people who actually voted Tory at the last general election to vote Labour,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwoeTFP5zOk">Smith said in Bristol</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This two million figure, I imagine, comes from the Conservative lead in the popular vote over Ed Miliband’s Labour at the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results">2015 general election</a>, 11.3 million to 9.3 million.</p>
<p>Of course, total votes doesn’t translate neatly into total seats — on vote share the Tories are overrepresented by 91 seats, Labour 34 — but you can see the principle.</p>
<p>This also underlies the idea that each vote taken off the Conservatives counts double, as they’re Labour’s main national opponents.</p>
<p>Taking votes off the Tories is a plausible strategy. In an abstract way, the numbers work, but it raises some difficult questions. “Winning over Tory voters” is traditionally code for adopting right-wing policies and it’s not clear if Tory voters would ever switch to Labour in sufficient numbers, let alone what it would do to Labour as a “democratic socialist party.”</p>
<p>However, this has been presented as the <em>only</em> way that Labour can win, usually by people who would like Labour to shift to the right regardless. But it’s very clearly not the only way Labour can win.</p>
<p>An unstated but clear part of the argument is the idea that voters come from some finite pool — as they do, but not in the way these people suggest — and so votes must be taken from other parties. There are no substantial parties to Labour’s left, so you must look to the right.</p>
<p>This is nonsense, as this chart shows:</p>
<p class="full-width">
    <img
        alt="Plot showing Labour and Conservative popular vote between 1992 and 2015"
        src="/images/lab_con_1992-2015.svg"
        class="no-border">
</p>

<p>Between the 1997 victory and 2010 defeat, Labour lost 4.9 million votes. These votes largely didn’t go to the Conservatives. In 2001 both lost many votes, and the Tory recovery in 2005 was small compared to the number of votes Labour lost again.</p>
<p>The imbalance between Labour’s losses and the fortunes of other parties can be seen in the following chart. While some Labour votes may go elsewhere, they don’t make up the full picture.</p>
<p class="full-width">
    <img
        alt="Plot showing the change in the Labour vote, others’ vote and total change compared with the previous election between 1997 and 2015"
        src="/images/vote_change_1992-2015.svg"
        class="no-border">
</p>

<p>The answer is turnout. (Brace for percentages.)</p>
<p>The 1997 election had a very low turnout by historic standards, at 71.4% the lowest since 1935. But things got worse in 2001, which had the lowest turnout (59.4%) since 1918 (57.2%).</p>
<p>(As an aside, 1918 is an interesting election, numbers-wise. It was the first in which women could vote, but only if they met certain property qualifications and were at least 30 years old — an age picked to ensure they were in the minority. For men all property rules were scrapped and they could vote from age 21. But the recently ended war and 107 uncontested seats meant that relatively few people voted.)</p>
<p>Turnout has recovered somewhat since 2001 — to 66.2% in 2015 — but the past 20 years form a noticeable trough in the past century. So for the question: “Where did 4.9 million Labour voters go?” a large part of the answer is: “Home.”</p>
<p>The following chart shows the evaporation of Labour votes, and puts the party’s total in the context of turnout and the size of the electorate:</p>
<p class="full-width">
    <img
        alt="Plot showing the size of the electorate, total number of votes and total Labour vote between 1992 and 2015"
        src="/images/lab_electorate_1992-2015.svg"
        class="no-border">
</p>

<p>People who make the “votes must come from the Tories” argument are restricting themselves to a section of the electorate that is to a certain extent already committed to voting. It is a truism in Britain that the elderly and the rich are more likely to vote, and they’re more likely to vote for the right.</p>
<p>But, as the chart above shows, a huge chunk of the electorate regularly does not vote at all. Since 2001 that chunk has been a <em>full third</em> of those registered.</p>
<p>I’d argue that a strategy based on a right-wing policy shift in order to poach Tory voters would further alienate many people who previously did not vote. That certainly appears to the be the story of the past two decades — after booting out the Tories in ’97 people abandoned Labour as the neoliberal character of the New Labour project became ever clearer. The refusal of the Ed Miliband-Ed Balls leadership to break cleanly from neoliberalism shoulders much of the blame for the 2015 election defeat.</p>
<p>Everyone who’s watched The West Wing can probably recall that “Democrats win when turnout is high.” I don’t fully support that claim because it’s too simplistic and I feel it reduces what should be a more philosophical political debate — about what kind of society we want and the most just and effective way to achieve it — to one about tactics.</p>
<p>But, before Corbyn, it had been a long time since Labour’s policies looked towards real social democracy, let alone socialism. Those kinds of policies would help enormously the mass of people in Britain, across the board. A sustained campaign to reconnect with communities and show that if we fight together in that direction we can improve everyone’s lives has, I think, a far greater chance of pulling in enough of those non-voters to secure victory. And hey, <a href="https://youtu.be/G9NPF1iXBjw?t=56s">a few ex-Tory voters might see something in it for them</a> too.</p>
<p>Scotland’s experience of the independence referendum, engaging very many people in a political question that they felt they had both a stake in and influence over, shows that is is possible to draw in people who previously did not participate. Turnout in Scotland shot up from 63.8% in 2010 to 71% in 2015, with the independence referendum held in September 2014 (with a 84.6% turnout).</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Labour much of that energy swung behind the Scottish Nationalists, for a variety of reasons that were long in the making.</p>
<p>But is does show that a campaign that really speaks to people — and listens to them! — can draw in many people who had previously shrugged off the whole affair.</p>

    <p>I joined the Labour Party on the Monday after the European Union referendum vote and the start of the MPs’ revolt against Jeremy Corbyn, so perhaps it’s unwise for me to write this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bfawu.org/statement_from_ronnie_draper_general_secretary_of_bfawu">No-one is safe</a>, it seems. But I’ve already voted in the leadership election so if the Compliance Unit wants to take issue then let it.</p>
<p>The actions of a small fringe in the Labour Party are horrifying and hypocritical. This group includes not a few MPs, party officials and other figures on the right of the party.</p>
<p>What’s most exasperating for me is the stunning mendacity, although perhaps it shouldn’t be given <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/The-Rise-of-Political-Lying/Peter-Oborne/9780743275606">the period when these people were at the height of their power</a>.</p>
<p>New scandals are dreamt up, exploited with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJCzVV5eIg8">theatrical abandon</a> and forgotten about when people see through them or the wheels fall off because of their internal contradictions (“Corbyn is sexist because most of his shadow cabinet are women”).</p>
<p>Meanwhile entirely different standards are applied to figures on the left and right. Post a couple of tweets critical of certain party rightwingers and you’re out, but <a href="http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-bc91-labour-HQ-in-poison-purge-of-union-leader">donate £2,125,000 to an opposing party and you’re golden</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder whether they truly believe what they’re saying. This nonsense about <a href="https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-51a8-Watson-and-Eagle-sling-more-slurs">a hundred thousand Trotskyists “twisting arms”</a>, for example. Given Watson’s record it’s liable to just be cynical rubbish, mud thrown in aid of a broader goal, but some people have comprehensively lost the plot.</p>
<p>Then there’s obvious cynicism, like everyone suddenly forgetting what a fringe meeting is. When <a href="http://www.peoplesmomentum.com">Momentum</a> plans a fringe it’s a “conference-within-a-conference,” <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardAngell/status/766320234974351360">according to the director of right-wing Labour faction Progress</a>.</p>
<p>But when <a href="http://www.progressonline.org.uk/progress-at-labour-party-conference-2016/">Progress plans 10 events at Labour conference</a>? No problem. Not even <a href="http://www.progressonline.org.uk/event/in-conversation-with-angela-eagle-mp-how-will-labour-work-with-business-to-deliver-a-new-economy-with-the-bvca/">when it’s backed by venture capital sharks</a>, who handily have previously given £39,630 to Progress.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Momentum’s event is somehow “in association with the Communist Party of Britain” because <a href="https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/">our paper</a> is involved!</p>
<p>Two of the Star’s three most senior editors are Labour Party members. We have seven Labour-affiliated trade unions on our management committee.</p>
<p>But our use of the Communist Party’s sensible programme, <a href="http://www.communist-party.org.uk/socialism/socialism.html">Britain’s Road to Socialism</a>, whose call for the election of a left government seems to chime with my Labour Party card’s declaration that it is “a democratic socialist party”, is clearly too much.</p>
<p>But the fact that Progress — in the words of supportive MP Tristram Hunt, an “unaccountable faction dominated by a secretive billionaire” — gets £260,000 a year from Lord Sainsbury is naturally not problematic. Any accusation that a group funded by a Lib Dem donor is holding a rival to the Labour Party conference is baseless, obviously.</p>
<p>I’m currently reading Chris Mullin’s <a href="https://serpentstail.com/a-very-british-coup.html">A Very British Coup</a>, having just finished Seumas Milne’s <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/1655-the-enemy-within">The Enemy Within</a> — about the attempts to crush the 1984–85 miners’ strike and its leaders. There are uncomfortable echoes of these books in the actions of the Labour right. The lies. The smears. The theatrics. The hypocrisy. It’s horrid. And these people are meant to be our comrades?</p>

    <p>Earlier today I switched the site off Tumblr and to my own server, hosted by Linode. So if you can see this, that’s a good sign! If you’re reading the RSS feed you might see some duplicate entries but that should settle down.</p>
<p>It’s now being served as a bunch of static HTML files created with a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/robjwells/majestic">Python site generator I wrote</a>. It’s not going to replace any of the established ones for anybody, but it was interesting to write and is fairly easy to understand. I’ll write about it when I’ve cleaned up the project.</p>
<p>The site isn’t missing anything, so it’s done in that regard, but there’s still some things left over on my end. For a start, a BBEdit preview template and a makefile to automate the last bits.</p>

      <h2 class="mute-links"><a href="https://robjwells.github.io/2015/10/re-unresponsive/">Re: Unresponsive</a></h2>
      <p><time datetime="2015-10-06T02:33">Tuesday, October 6 2015</time></p>
    </header>
    <p><a href="http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/10/unresponsive/">Dr Drang posted recently</a> about his trouble getting his site to work with the new responsive design mode in Safari 9 (which is very similar to the Firefox feature of the same name). He also detailed the complicated setup he has for providing his current mobile layout to small, portrait screens (ie phones) — media queries in HTML link tags and separate stylesheet files.</p>
<p>(I should also point out, if Dr Drang is reading, that his mobile.css file is missing the rule for <code>#content iframe</code>. I’m not sure if this is deliberate.)</p>
<p>Since I’ve fought with responsive design a couple of times, and seemingly have a need to stick my nose into other people’s business, I wondered how difficult it would be to combine the two separate CSS files and get responsive design mode to work.</p>
<p>To give some context to what’s discussed, I’ve put up <a href="https://gist.github.com/robjwells/d1c38b72ddc292ac42e1">a gist containing the combined CSS file and required HTML changes</a>. In the CSS file you’ll want to look at the end part, <a href="https://gist.github.com/robjwells/d1c38b72ddc292ac42e1#file-drang-combined-css-L809">from line 809</a>. That part contains two media queries, which split out:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rules only for small portrait screens (ie phones).</li>
<li>Rules for everyone else (but <em>not</em> small portrait screens).</li>
</ol>
<p>The two diffs at the top show the changes from Dr Drang’s mobile.css and style.css. The combined file is based on the main stylesheet, which is why there are more changes in the mobile diff.</p>
<p>Most of the changes that make up the Doc’s mobile style sheet are <code>font-size</code> declarations to boost the text size — and these don’t appear in the combined file, which points to the most interesting aspect of this and something that had me confused for not a short while.</p>
<p>Basically, Dr Drang’s mobile style sheet increases the text size to compensate for the mobile browser rendering at “full size” (980px in Safari on iOS). (This is how <a href="https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ?t=2515">the New York Times website looked normal in the first iPhone demo</a> in 2007.) The usual technique is to tell the browser to render at “device size” through the use of a <code>meta</code> HTML tag:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">meta</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;viewport&quot;</span> <span class="na">content</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It took me a while to work out that this combined with Dr Drang’s larger text to make everything appear massive:</p>
<p>
    <img
        alt="My CSS changes to the And Now It's All This mobile css file caused the text to become huge."
        src="/images/2015-10-06_massive.png"
        width="320">
</p>

<p>So those rules went, and some new ones to fix the size of the header came in. But otherwise there are no changes to the styles.</p>
<p>The change in approach means that the result isn’t an exact match for the real site:</p>
<p class="full-width">
    <img
        alt="A portrait comparison of my CSS changes to the real And Now It's All This site."
        src="/images/2015-10-06_portrait-comparison.png"
        width="641">
</p>

<p>And in landscape the fixed sizes in the CSS file combine with the use of “device size” to produce a layout that’s larger than the screen width, forcing Safari to resize the viewport until it <em>just</em> fits:</p>
<p class="full-width">
    <img
        alt="A landscape comparison of my CSS changes to the real And Now It's All This site."
        src="/images/2015-10-06_landscape-comparison.png"
        width="568">

<p>The changes mean that responsive design mode in Safari works for portrait mode:</p>
<p class="full-width">
    <img
        alt="My CSS changes to And Now It's All This in Safari's responsive design mode in portrait."
        src="/images/2015-10-06_portrait-rdm.png">
</p>

<p>But landscape mode is not accurate, as there isn’t the viewport-resizing that squeezes the too-large layout to fit on the phone itself:</p>

        alt="My CSS changes to And Now It's All This in Safari's responsive design mode in portrait."
        src="/images/2015-10-06_landscape-rdm.png">
</p>

<p>Lastly, I’m going to close with my tips for not going completely mad when trying to make a responsive layout:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have the main part of the CSS file — before any media queries — produce a usable single-column layout (ie for phones).</li>
<li>Try to have media queries build on previous rules instead of trying to undo them.</li>
<li>Use as few media queries, and as few rules within them, as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve recently rewritten this site’s CSS to prepare for <a href="https://bitbucket.org/robjwells/majestic/">a behind-the-scenes change</a>. Compared to the current stylesheet, first written in 2013, it’s much saner — specifically with regards to media queries but also in general.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/robjwells/9026d9da9c19c5f24ad7">the current stylesheet</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/robjwells/primaryunit-2015/src/572cbd62d4e5c54804a608398a39aeac3777a88e/css/styles.css">the new one</a> if you want to take a look. In the new file the main part, before any media queries, creates a small layout, which is finessed by a mid-sized media query, then finally adjusted for larger screens.</p>
