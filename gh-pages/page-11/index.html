      <p><time datetime="2015-09-21T20:42">Monday, September 21 2015</time></p>
    </header>
    <p>Today’s allegations in the Mail are completely tedious in almost all aspects yet are interesting in one.</p>
<p>Frankly if you’ve gone this long thinking that David Cameron had any shred of humanity there’s no helping you. The 2010–15 Con-Dem coalition was plenty vicious and immediately after winning a majority in May the first thing the Tories did was to <a href="http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-483d-Tories-move-quickly-to-sneak-in-work-funds-cap">screw over deaf and blind people starting work</a>. The day after the vote. These people have no shame and are solely concerned with the interests of their class.</p>
<p>Which is what makes this interesting. Billionaire tax-dodger Michael Ashcroft, the Tories’ former top donor, and the class-warriors at the Mail know full well that their interests are best served by a Tory government. Ashcroft may well feel snubbed at not getting a cabinet job but with £1 billion in the bank there’s plenty he could to do keep himself occupied.</p>
<p>I think this attack on Cameron is meant to make his replacement as Tory leader more palatable. None of the top Tories seem human and they must know it. Boris “three jobs” Johnson, for instance, is known to have been a member of the Bullingdon Club and has admitted taking drugs. (He’s also quite a vicious rightwinger with a tendency to get nasty when challenged, but let’s stick to perceptions.) By painting Cameron as a complete degenerate — a drug-addled ultra-posh pervert who hates ordinary folk — suddenly Johnson (or whichever pretender) seems a lot more acceptable.</p>
<p>Ashcroft’s co-author Isabel Oakeshott <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/21/cameron-hit-by-student-drugs-and-debauchery-allegations-in-ashcroft-biography-politics-live#block-5600065be4b0764b4fbfb7ab">made clear to the BBC</a> that publishing the book after the election was done to protect the party. Again: this tax-dodging billionaire knows exactly who his mates are and wants them to stay in charge. It’s just that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32022484">Cameron’s through</a> and the Tories are suddenly faced with a Labour Party led by <a href="https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-d997-Jeremy-Corbyn-Thank-you-all-for-making-this-happen">a decent human being with decent policies</a>.</p>
<p>Bumping off Cameron and replacing him with someone who’s not seen to be a disgusting pervert who despises the working class (the bigger challenge) is — along with the continuing barrage of media lies against Jeremy Corbyn — the only way to challenge that.</p>

      <p><time datetime="2015-08-10T22:34">Monday, August 10 2015</time></p>
    </header>
    <p>I made a mistake in <a href="/2015/08/python-counter-gotcha-with-max/">my recent post about Python’s Counter class</a> by using numbers in the example rather than strings. It meant it wasn’t clear what I actually wanted out of the counter. (While I was writing it, I was getting confused between the keys and their counts myself. I should have taken the hint.) That post’s now been updated.</p>
<p>I had a lovely email from <a href="http://jacobsondergaard.com">Jacob Söndergaard</a> that prompted me into clarifying things, and also started me thinking about ways you can still use <code>max</code> on the counter to get the most common item. Here’s what I’ve got:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">collections</span> <span class="k">import</span> <span class="n">Counter</span>
<span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Counter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;abracadabra&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">most_common</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">max</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">items</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here <code>max</code> gets a sequence of tuples (key, count) from <code>c.items()</code> and the custom <code>key</code> function tells it to choose the greatest element based on the count. The <code>[0]</code> index at the end ensures you just get the key, not the count.</p>
<p>But should you do this? No. Please don’t. At this point you’re effectively duplicating the way that Counter implements <code>.most_common()</code> internally. (Here’s <a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Lib/collections/__init__.py#l530">the Python source for the method</a>.) That’s at best too — the implementation does something more complicated if you only want the top n most-common elements.</p>
<p>Also: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH850qp85Zk">Abracadabra</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="mute-links"><a href="https://robjwells.github.io/2015/08/python-counter-gotcha-with-max/">Python Counter gotcha with max</a></h2>
      <p><time datetime="2015-08-07T13:49">Friday, August 7 2015</time></p>
    </header>
    <div class="flag">
  <p><strong>Update 2015-08-10</strong></p>
  <p>
    The example given now uses strings as the keys instead of numbers
    to ward off any confusion between the keys and their counts.
  </p>
</div>

<p>Getting the greatest element from a sequence in Python is dead simple: just use the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=max#max">max</a> function.</p>
<p>Storing the frequency of items is also dead easy with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html?highlight=collections.counter#collections.Counter">collections.Counter</a>:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">collections</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Counter</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Counter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;abracadabra&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Counter({&#39;a&#39;: 5, &#39;b&#39;: 2, &#39;r&#39;: 2, &#39;c&#39;: 1, &#39;d&#39;: 1})</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The greatest item in a counter is obviously the most common, so surely we’ll just …</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">max</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&#39;r&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p><em>What?</em> Here’s the gotcha: Python counters are a dictionary subclass. Call <code>max</code> with a dictionary and it’ll get the greatest key, because keys are what you get when you iterate over a dictionary. Same deal.</p>
<p>To get the most common element you have to use — surprise! — <code>Counter.most_common()</code>. Without arguments this produces a list of tuples (item, count), sorted by count:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">most_common</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="go">[(&#39;a&#39;, 5), (&#39;b&#39;, 2), (&#39;r&#39;, 2), (&#39;c&#39;, 1), (&#39;d&#39;, 1)]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So to get the actual most common element, you do:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">most_common</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="go">&#39;a&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Where the argument <code>1</code> limits it to the first tuple.</p>
<p>But what if the counter’s empty? You’ll get an IndexError trying to index into the list returned by <code>most_common()</code>:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Counter</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">d</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">most_common</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="go">[]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">d</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">most_common</span><span class="p">()[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gt">Traceback (most recent call last):</span>
  File <span class="nb">&quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;</span>, line <span class="m">1</span>, in <span class="n">&lt;module&gt;</span>
<span class="gr">IndexError</span>: <span class="n">list index out of range</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In Python 3.4 <code>max</code> got the <code>default</code> argument, which you can use to get a default value when a sequence is empty. Here’s how to get similar behaviour with Counter:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="n">d</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">most_common</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="kc">None</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This takes advantage of the "falsey" nature of an empty dictionary to give you <code>None</code> without having to handle an IndexError.</p>

    <p>For some reason, the other day I was thinking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Senior">Junior Senior</a>. I knew they had a pop hit something like 10 years ago but I just couldn’t place it at all: what it was called, what it sounded like, who they were, nothing.</p>
<p>Until this morning, when I looked them up and ended up watching the video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPlQpGeTbIE">Move Your Feet on YouTube</a> — and that was it, that video. It’s so good.</p>
<p>There’s just something about that super-happy, pixel art craziness. The dancing toast really clicked in my brain for some reason. I had to share — click the image below to load the gif.</p>

<p>Since 100 words about a 12-year-old pop track with an amusing video feels like I’m cheating you, dear reader, here’s some technical stuff about doing easy click-to-start gifs.</p>
<p>I wanted to share that toast clip but after reading <a href="http://jacquesmattheij.com/the-fastest-blog-in-the-world">Jacques Mattheij’s post The Fastest Blog in the World</a> I was a little wary about dumping a 150KB image onto my front page just for a bit of whimsy. That attitude’s quite silly when you consider that the weight of the Primary Unit front page before this post went up was a full 883kB — nearly three-quarters of which is Tumblr’s crap that is out of my control. But anyway.</p>

<p>I grabbed the first frame and saved it as a png. At 1.5kB it wasn’t worth the extra request or bothering uploading the file, so I turned it into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/data_URIs">a base64 data URI</a> and put it in-line (note the placeholder on line 2). From the command line:</p>
<pre><code>uuencode -m infile remotename</code></pre>


<p>The <code>remotename</code> just gets included in the header line, which you ditch, but you have to give something to the command.</p>
<p>Next we’ve got a little in-line JavaScript which grabs the <code>img</code> by its ID. It registers an event handler so that, when the image is clicked, if the <code>src</code> attribute is anything but the gif URL, it swaps it out and saves the old <code>src</code>. Click the image again and it restores the old <code>src</code> — in this case stopping the gif by substituting back in the data URI, but you could use it to swap two images or similar.</p>

    <p>Quite surprisingly the <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/leadership">Labour leadership contest</a> has turned out to be pretty interesting — almost entirely because of Jeremy Corbyn. I’m not going to run down why Corbyn is easily the best candidate, with easily the best policies. He’s a principled man with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:morningstaronline.co.uk+%22Jeremy+Corbyn%22&amp;t=osx">a deep commitment to building a better society</a>.</p>
<p>What interests me is the reaction to his campaign in the mass media. At every election it focuses on the trivial rather than policy, but in the leadership contest this has been even more obvious. There’s been an almost blanket refusal to engage with <a href="http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/news">Corbyn’s policies</a> (save <a href="http://morningstaronline.co.uk">our paper</a>) — despite <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-jeremy-corbyn-policies-that-most-people-actually-agree-with-10407148.html">mass public support</a>.</p>
<p>A good chunk of the past few weeks has been spent <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/22/jeremy-corbyn-gathers-support-from-communist-party-ukip-and-tories">fretting</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/26/jeremy-corbyn-genuine-labour-supporters-leadership-election">about</a> supposed infiltration of the Labour Party by the “hard left” and Tories. (The Guardian’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/22/jeremy-corbyn-gathers-support-from-communist-party-ukip-and-tories">reference</a> to the Communist Party is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-33680629">wrong</a>.) The funniest part of this was the Telegraph <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11741861/How-you-can-help-Jeremy-Corbyn-win-and-destroy-the-Labour-Party.html">urging its readers to skew the vote</a>, before <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11767152/Tories-dont-vote-for-Jeremy-Corbyn.-It-wont-end-well.html">remembering</a> that people are smart enough to recognise policies that are in their interest so it’s best not to draw attention to them. But the actual cuckoo in the nest is right-wing party-within-a-party Progress, as <a href="https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-7dd3-Who-are-the-real-entryists#.VcBwGHhanTQ">Solomon Hughes writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The press and television have been mesmerised by the non-existent conspiracy of 150,000 co-ordinated “hard leftists” paying their £3 memberships to join Labour. At the same time they have ignored a million-pound operation to stop Corbyn and boost Liz Kendall — an operation that even one of its leading members calls “an unaccountable faction dominated by a secretive billionaire.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The real fear, as shown by that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11767152/Tories-dont-vote-for-Jeremy-Corbyn.-It-wont-end-well.html">second Telegraph link</a>, is that if Corbyn wins it will drag the centre of political debate to the left — which the right <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/26/smart-tories-labour-jeremy-corbyn-mania-david-cameron">openly acknowledges</a>. It’s this (as well as apprehension about the unwashed masses mucking in) that has spun the Guardian and Observer — the “left-wing” papers — into a frenzy. For them, the <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/leadership/candidate/andy-burnham">three</a> <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/leadership/candidate/yvette-cooper">right-wing</a> <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/leadership/candidate/liz-kendall">candidates</a> are far enough apart to have a reasonable contest, which <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/corbyn-tribe-identity-politics-labour">should focus on tactics</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-labour-leadership-analogue-contest-in-a-digital-age">anyway</a>.</p>

<p>This kind of behaviour should raise flags for anyone who’s read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">Manufacturing Consent</a> — still the best book on the media after 27 years — where the role of the New York Times as serving as the boundary of acceptable “left-wing” thought in the US is made clear: “<a href="https://chomsky.info/1992____02/">thus far and no further</a>.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, this barrage hasn’t deterred tens of thousands of people registering as Labour supporters to back Corbyn, packing out rallies to the point where <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/03/jeremy-corbyn-bid-labour-leadership-momentum-supporters-flock-london-rally">he has to speak to them in the street</a>. There’s <a href="https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-146f-Corbyns-not-home-and-dry,-warns-MP#.VcB-ynhanTQ">much work left to do</a> — we still face a united ruling class that is carrying out ever more savage attacks on us — but it’s nice to have some good news.</p>
