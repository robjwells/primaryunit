      <p><time datetime="2013-06-25T00:52">Tuesday, June 25 2013</time></p>
    </header>
    <p>The JavaScript and CSS files for this site live on Amazon S3, but getting them up there can be a chore once you consider compression and uploading with the right headers.</p>
<p>That wasn’t too difficult to sort out with AppleScript and Transmit but I wanted to avoid having to start the script manually as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a>, the housekeeper for your Mac, can keep watch and is ideal for this — except when you’re still working on the file. It’s going to get under your feet if you tell it to run its rules once the modification date is after the last match.</p>
<p>If the files are under version control the commit status is an ideal way to signal whether or not a file is ready to go. Combine that with Hazel’s ability to use a shell script in its conditions and you end up with something like this:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Sites/robjwells
<span class="nv">GITSTATUS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>git status <span class="p">|</span> head -n <span class="m">2</span> <span class="p">|</span> tail -n <span class="m">1</span> <span class="p">|</span> grep -o <span class="s2">&quot;^nothing&quot;</span><span class="k">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$GITSTATUS</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;nothing&quot;</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    <span class="nb">exit</span> <span class="m">0</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
    <span class="nb">exit</span> <span class="m">1</span>
<span class="k">fi</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(This is my first time writing about a purely shell script, so please be gentle.)</p>
<p>First it moves into the directory in question, which is a git repo.
Next it calls <code>git status</code>, extracts the second line of the output (<code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>) and checks if it starts with “nothing”. That’s because the status command returns this on a clean repo:</p>
<pre><code># On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>


<p>If <code>grep</code> finds “nothing” it gets stuck in <code>$GITSTATUS</code>, which is compared to the string you would expect from a clean repo. If it matches the script exits with a success status code, which tells Hazel that the file has passed the check.</p>
<p>(The -o flag makes <code>grep</code> only return the match, instead of the whole line.)</p>
<p>Initially I did this check in the AppleScript that was applied to the file once it passed date and extension checks. But this meant that Hazel considered it to have matched successfully and would not run the rules on the file until it triggered the date conditions again. The lesson here is that checks must be separate from actions. Thankfully Hazel makes it easy to do that.</p>
<p>If you work with repositories which are rarely “all clear” as in this case, you could improve this snippet by <a href="/2013/06/more-precise-git-status-gating/">checking the status tool’s list of uncommitted modified files for the name of the file</a> (provided by Hazel as <code>$1</code>).</p>

    <p>I thought it was time for a change on this blog, as I’ve never been particularly happy it and have lost count of the number of major changes it has been through.</p>
<p>The domain’s been mine since 2008 or 2009, the back-end has been switched at least five times between Blogger, WordPress and Tumblr, and there are so few posts — and none from before last year — because almost all were crap and I didn’t want my name associated with them.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that robjwells.com has not had an easy life so far, aside from being left alone most of the time.</p>
<p>But I have spent a lot of time thinking about what I want this blog to be and an even longer time making a design that I am happy with.</p>
<p>I had always wanted to change the design to something of my own because despite trying plenty of themes there was always <em>something</em> that annoyed me.</p>
<p>However, I was reluctant to put in the time if I was just going to neglect the blog or fill it with the same rubbish I’d spent five years being embarrassed by.</p>
<p>Things changed after I started reading <a href="http://leancrew.com/">Dr Drang’s blog</a> this year. He’s prolific and writes interesting posts about all kinds of stuff. I often search his site for ideas or as a reference on computer topics.</p>
<p>Over the weekend I spent a while looking at his earliest entries — from eight years ago! The amount of effort and thought he had put in was clear and over time it must have stuck.</p>
<p>(What a revelation! I’m sure there’s an equally revelatory Malcolm Gladwell book about it or something.)</p>
<p>Good work takes hard work and, with that in mind, I’m going to have another crack at this thing. In a bid to break with the past I’ve also given it a proper name after years of suffering as “Rob’s blog”.</p>

    </header>
    <p>A quick and hopefully final update on my short AppleScript to restart from Mac OS X into your Bootcamp partition.</p>
<p><a href="/2012/10/restart-in-windows-revenge-of-the-script/">The last time we looked at this</a> I had cobbled together some AppleScript, <code>grep</code> and <code>awk</code> for a fairly reliable script, but it required some fiddling if you were still using Leopard (10.5).</p>
<p>I’ve revised the script again, this time relying on the <code>$NF</code> variable in <code>awk</code> to extract the last field. That makes using <code>diskutil list</code> easy, and so I now recommend the following for all users, including those on Leopard or Tiger:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">deviceID</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">do shell script</span> <span class="s2">&quot;diskutil list ¬</span>
<span class="s2">  | awk &#39;/YourBootcampPartition/ {print $NF}&#39;&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">do shell script</span> <span class="s2">&quot;bless -device /dev/&quot;</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="nv">deviceID</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="se">¬</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot; -legacy -setBoot -nextonly&quot;</span> <span class="se">¬</span>
  <span class="nv">with</span> <span class="nv">administrator</span> <span class="nv">privileges</span>
<span class="k">tell</span> <span class="nb">application</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Finder&quot;</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="nv">restart</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here’s the shell part to get the identifier on its own:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span>diskutil list <span class="p">|</span> awk <span class="s1">&#39;/YourBootcampPartition/ {print $NF}&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To be clear, the name of the partition <strong>must go between the two slashes</strong>.</p>
<p>Aside from making it a purely shell script, which causes problems with prompting for the user’s credentials, I can’t see how this can get any simpler and so I fully expect this to be the last time I write about it.</p>
<p>I’ve uploaded <a href="https://gist.github.com/robjwells/3681949">the script as a Gist</a>, if you’d like to star or fork it.</p>

      <p><time datetime="2013-03-06T10:45">Wednesday, March 6 2013</time></p>
    </header>
    <p>I suck at dates. Badly.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are a few ways to get around this in software — not least <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a>, Smile’s ace text-substitution program. (I don’t use it nearly enough, but <a href="http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/textexpander">I’m looking to fix that</a>.)</p>
<p>TextExpander has a lot of date placeholders, so it’s obvious that I’m not the only one that needs help with this — but I may well be the first to be <em>this</em> bad. Here’s a list of the snippets in my Time &amp; Date folder:</p>
<pre><code>;mdate   -&gt;   March 6 2013
;*ddate  -&gt;   Wednesday March 6 2013
;ds      -&gt;   _0306_0914
;time    -&gt;   09:14
;bd      -&gt;   20130306
;ldate   -&gt;   March 6, 2013
;sdate   -&gt;   06/03/2013
;dt      -&gt;   09:14, March 6, 2013</code></pre>


<p>Those eight snippets include <em>seven</em> different ways to get the date, and <em>three</em> different ways to get the time. The worst part about this is that I can never remember which abbreviation corresponds to which date format.</p>
<p>Ok, let’s fix this. How many formats do I really need? I need a short date, a more human-friendly long date, the time, and the format used at <a href="http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk">work</a>.</p>
<p>So that’s four — only half as bad as before!</p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>I’m sticking with my old <code>;time</code> snippet here, a colon-separated 24-hour time. If I need a more human-friendly time, typing 10am or 8pm or whatever is as easy as typing an abbreviation (and TextExpander only does uppercase AM/PM, which I dislike). Here’s the snippet:</p>
<pre><code>%H:%M   -&gt;    10:23</code></pre>


<h3>Short date</h3>
<p>Because, well, <a href="http://xkcd.com/1179/">XKCD</a>, I’m going to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 date format</a> for this. It means I can dump my separate backwards date snippet and avoids any confusion across DD/MM/YY and MM/DD/YY countries.</p>
<pre><code>%Y-%m-%d    -&gt;  2013-03-06</code></pre>


<h3>Long date</h3>
<p>Since this is implicitly not the format to use when you’re counting characters and one that’s explicit enough to avoid confusion, there’s quite a bit of personal freedom here.</p>
<p>This one’s going to be more complicated than the previous two, as I want to use date suffixes (March 2nd, April 21st, etc). But TextExpander doesn't include a suffix placeholder, so let’s take advantage of its script support.</p>
<p>AppleScript’s built-in <code>current date</code> command returns an object from which we can extract all the pieces we need to construct a date, like so:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">theDate</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="nb">the</span> <span class="nb">day</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nb">the</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">current date</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">theDay</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="nb">the</span> <span class="nv">weekday</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nb">the</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">current date</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">theMonth</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="nb">the</span> <span class="nb">month</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nb">the</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">current date</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">theYear</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="nb">the</span> <span class="nb">year</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nb">the</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">current date</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now to build the suffix. Most dates have the suffix “th”, so we want to focus on the special cases: 1, 2, 3, 21, 22, and 31. We could check for each of these but there’s a smarter way.</p>
<p>We need to pull the date’s <strong>last</strong> character, which determines the suffix, so we can work with both single and double-digit dates:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">lastChar</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">the</span> <span class="nb">last</span> <span class="nb">character</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">theDate</span> <span class="k">as </span><span class="nc">string</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="se">¬</span>
 <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nv">number</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now we check for the most common situation (“th”) by testing <code>lastChar</code> against a range:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">lastChar</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="nv">lastChar</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">theDate</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span> <span class="ow">and</span><span class="se">¬</span>
 <span class="nv">theDate</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">21</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    <span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">theDate</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">theDate</span> <span class="k">as </span><span class="nc">string</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;th&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If we put the other suffixes in order and in a list, we can use the last character of the date itself to extract the correct suffix:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">theSuffixes</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;st&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;nd&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;rd&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">theDate</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">theDate</span> <span class="k">as </span><span class="nc">string</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">item</span> <span class="nv">lastChar</span><span class="se">¬</span>
 <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nv">theSuffixes</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now let’s roll it up and <code>return</code> a constructed date:</p>
<div class="syntax"><pre><span></span><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">theDate</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="nb">the</span> <span class="nb">day</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nb">the</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">current date</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">lastChar</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="nv">lastChar</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">theDate</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span> <span class="ow">and</span><span class="se">¬</span>

      <p><time datetime="2013-02-25T14:58">Monday, February 25 2013</time></p>
    </header>
    <p>For the last few months I’ve been working, on and off, on a little web project — <a href="http://robjwells.github.com/veintiuno">a basic blackjack game you can play in your browser</a>. It’s not going to win any awards but it was a fun exercise to teach myself some JavaScript, HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>I got the idea for it after finishing <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript-original">Codecademy’s original JavaScript course</a>, where you spend some time working on the basics behind such a game. At the very end of the course, once you’ve put all the pieces together, you’re encouraged to keep working on it to see what you can improve.</p>
<p>One of the leads is to improve the way the players’ hands are displayed by printing a more human-friendly message to the console. But I thought perhaps there was a way to improve the interface further, by breaking the game out of the console and hooking it up to a visual display in the browser proper. And, well, <a href="http://robjwells.github.com/veintiuno">this is what I’ve got</a> — and I encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/robjwells/veintiuno">poke around the code</a> as well.</p>
<p>The core game logic is more or less the same, though I’ve taken time to improve certain aspects — dealing cards from a depleting deck, having the dealer hit on “soft” 17 (mostly for the challenge), better feedback, hiding the dealer’s hole card, and a few other bits.</p>
<p>Since it hasn’t changed radically, I was surprised to find that the JavaScript file is now over four times longer than what I had when I finished the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> track.</p>
<p>I think that mirrors my surprise at how much work it actually was to get everything hooked up, working right and looking good enough to put out into the world without me dying of embarrassment. (And most of the extra JavaScript lines are related to connecting with HTML &amp; CSS.)</p>
<p>Man, web design is <em>hard</em>. Well, it was hard for me — I guess because what little I did know was all geared towards making “regular” web pages, where you’ve got some text and maybe some images and maybe a list or two and <em>not</em> enough moving parts to construct a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine">Rube Goldberg Machine</a>.</p>
<p>I actually would have been finished a little while ago but I decided to junk my original design, which looked like the layout you get now when using a wider window, because cutting off screens thinner than 800px was just an enormous cop-out and I couldn’t stand it. It was made worse by the fact I’d started reading <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Ethan Marcotte’s Responsive Web Design</a>.</p>
<p>So now you’ll see a “narrow” layout with devices thinner than 800px, and a luxuriously spacious design on anything wider. If you have an iPad you can see both very easily: thin design in portrait, wide in landscape.</p>
<p>Speaking of the iPad, one of my goals was to not use any images that would get pixellated on high-DPI (retina) displays. I also wanted to keep the total file size as low as possible — one of the reasons I didn’t use jQuery and instead wrote my own helper functions.</p>
<p>So step in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>. The seven images used are all SVG files, weighing in at a whopping 12KB (and just 6KB when compressed).</p>
<p>The biggest file by far is the <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic">League Gothic</a> web font file, which I like a lot and wouldn’t change but it has caused me some headaches. It can display oddly, appearing overly bold in Chrome for example. And finding a fallback font was basically impossible, though the new designs get around that by not including fragile elements designed around the font’s particular shape and size.</p>
<p>The about button, styled as a red casino chip, is the only thing left of those fragile elements. Originally I had <a href="/images/2013-02-25_bjchips.png">two other chips</a>, with the number on their faces displaying the number of hands won and lost. I liked the look but they were ultimately so fiddly I ditched them for the simpler, clearer text-only counters.</p>
<p>These also display better in Firefox, as the tabs around the chips’ outside — originally faked using a dashed border — displayed as a solid ring (because of how Firefox handles high border-radius values).</p>
<p>Having said that, compatibility was not a priority for me. That would be stupid in the real world but I think I can get away with it here. This freed me up to use recent CSS features such as transforms, transitions, shadows, animation, new units, etc. (Since I mention animation, the overlays’ bounce effects come from <a href="http://daneden.me/animate/">Daniel Eden’s awesome animate.css</a>.)</p>
<p>While this has been liberating, it’s also made clear that there are some oddities in CSS and browsers’ implementations of it that can sometimes trip you up, with problems seemingly coming out of nowhere.</p>
<p>But practice looks to be the best way to clear up any confusion and I’m eager to learn and do more. I’ll probably make my own theme for this blog next, though I’m going to work through <a href="http://learningwebdesign.com">Jennifer Robbins’s Learning Web Design</a> first to make sure I have a firm footing.</p>
<p>I think that’s about it, so thanks for reading and if you have any questions or comments I’m <a href="http://twitter.com/robjwells">@robjwells on Twitter</a>.</p>
