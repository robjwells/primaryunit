title: About Primary Unit
slug: about

Primary Unit is written by me, Rob Wells. I work production at a newspaper in London, England.

This blog is my place to write about my hobbyist programming, games, plenty more computer stuff and, well, whatever else. You can subscribe to my posts by [RSS][].

I share my code on [Bitbucket][] and [GitHub][] and shorter snippets as [gists][], save interesting things on [Pinboard][], and very occasionally post photos on [Flickr][].

If you’d like to say hi, send an email to my first name at this website.

And [here’s my public key][pgp] if you need it for any reason.
