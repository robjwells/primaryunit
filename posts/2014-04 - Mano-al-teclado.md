In a [follow-up][drman2] to his [man page post][drman1], Dr Drang writes that he suspects the people who responded with keyboard-centric methods “were all slightly appalled by the notion of using the mouse or trackpad to bring up a man page.”

No such dismay here. While I generally prefer to keep my hands on the keyboard there are often cases when using the mouse is easier or faster, as explained in the [Bruce Tognazzini article][tog] Dr Drang quotes.

Not all keyboard shortcuts are created equal. In my [bookmarks bar post][bookm] I threw out one lot for another, as it was difficult to remember the shortcut for a particular function even though the key combinations were simple (`⌘-[1-9]`). This led to the situation Tog describes: it took longer to remember the shortcut than it would to use the mouse.

> Not only is this decision not boring, the user actually experiences amnesia!
> Real amnesia!

But I think indexes such as [LaunchBar][lb] (or [InDesign’s quick apply panel][idqap]) sidestep the problem. Here’s what Tog says about mouse users:

> They have not had to set their task aside to think about or remember abstract symbols.

That’s remarkably similar to using indexes: after typing a simple shortcut (`⌘-Space`, `⌘-↩`) to bring up the panel, a user just has to type their intent. I suspect that cuts down on the decision time substantially.
