title: Where could Labour’s votes come from?
date: 2016-08-31 08:00

It was suggested often during last year’s Labour leadership contest that if the party had Jeremy Corbyn at the helm it couldn’t win a general election. The argument holds that Corbyn, as a leftwinger, couldn’t appeal to people who had previously voted for the Tories, and these were the people Labour needed to win over in order to make the sums work.

At the time I considered writing a post about this idea, but events overtook me and I left it alone as the argument faded. But recently Corbyn’s opponent this year, Owen Smith, has used it.

> “It’s not just a question, as Jeremy said on a few occasions, [that] we need to get a few people who have contemplated voting Tory to vote Labour, we need to get two million people who actually voted Tory at the last general election to vote Labour,” [Smith said in Bristol][bristol-vid].

It’s easy to see where this two million figure comes from: it was the Conservative lead in the popular vote over Ed Miliband’s Labour at the [2015 general election][2015-ge], 11.3 million to 9.3m.

Of course, total votes don’t translate neatly into total seats — on vote share the Tories are overrepresented by 91 seats, Labour 34 — but you can see the principle.

This also underlies the idea that each vote taken off the Conservatives counts double, as they’re Labour’s main national opponents.

Now, leaving aside the disconnect between “socialist” Smith and that “winning over Tory voters” is traditionally code for adopting right-wing policies, taking votes from the Tories is a plausible strategy. There’s a discussion to be had about whether Tory voters would ever switch to Labour in sufficient numbers to justify the policy shift required, and whether that would be consistent with Smith’s “Labour values”, but yeah, in an abstract way the numbers work.

This has been presented as the *only* way that Labour can win, usually by people who would like Labour to shift to the right regardless. But it’s very clearly *not the only way Labour can win*.

Between the 1997 victory and 2010, Labour lost 4.9m votes. But these votes didn’t go to the Conservatives — Labour’s popular vote crashed in 2001, as did turnout. The 1997 election had the lowest turnout since 1935, and every election since has had a lower turnout than any after 1918.
