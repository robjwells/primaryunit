If you [register your Oyster card online][register], you can get [Transport for London][tfl] to send you a summary of your recent journey history, as either a PDF or a CSV file. I ignored it for years after I moved here because I couldn’t work out the use but decided in 2014 to keep a record of my own travel. I had nothing in particular in mind at the time, but I thought: “CSV! I can crunch the numbers at some point!”

Well, I’ve now amassed two years of travel logs. As I’ve just had to move from Woolwich it’s an appropriate time to look back, particularly as I now live just a short cycle from work and so won’t take the train. (In fact, I haven’t taken the train in over three weeks, which everything below stops in mid-August.)

In that time I’ve spent £1,487.85 on Oyster fares. The plot below shows what that looks like week by week.

The two horizontal bars at £10 and £15 are what I would spend a week on commuting with and without a [railcard discount][railcard]. You can see that the average roughly clings to that at periods.

The choice of a six-week moving average is arbitrary but does make a few things clearer: higher spending in late 2014 on non-work journeys (long trips that crossed fare zone 1), applying the railcard discount in spring 2015, losing that discount at the start of 2016, and a decline this summer as I cycled more.

But really my commuting costs were so low (zone 4 to 3, off-peak) that an extra return journey into central London could cause a spike. I had a £20 automatic top-up set up for when the card’s balance dipped below a certain threshold, and that kicked in 73 times, so about once every 10 days.

One thing that surprised me was the split between rail and bus. Even over such an extended period, I only made *21 bus journeys*. In fact, over half of those journeys (12) were made between midnight and 4am — saved by the night bus after the trains stop running. (I’ve yet to get [the Night Tube][nt], but I now live near a Central Line station so it’s unlikely many more bus journeys are in my future.)

In contrast I made *918 journeys by rail*, spending a total of 472 hours and 1 minute in the network (time between ticket barriers). My average journey time was between 26 and 31 minutes (depending how you count it). Here’s how the journey times break down (excluding one 104-minute outlier):

That big spike is my usual commute (more on which later). The one missing journey, a 104-minute journey from Boston Manor after a nice long walk along sections [six][cr6] and [seven][cr7] of the [Capital Ring][cr] with my mum & stepdad, is a real outlier. It’s nearly half an hour longer than the second longest, largely because we were coming back during rush hour so a long District Line ride to West Ham seemed preferable than trying to change somewhere more central and busier.

The next longest was a 77-minute journey from Woolwich Arsenal to Farringdon in May 2015, though I can’t work out why it took so long. (There was a power failure on the Jubilee Line that day, but later on.) The next one (70 minutes) is outgoing journey of the Boston Manor one — but to Wimbledon Park along a quicker route. A couple of similar ones, but nothing out of the ordinary.

The short journeys are almost all London Overground journeys from Hackney Wick, the nearest station to work, to Hackney Central, where there are pubs. (These journeys may continue!) Two of the 10 shortest journeys are from Stratford to Hackney Wick, which is one of the most pointless journeys — just walk through the Olympic Park.

Overall, that histogram is dominated by the half-hour length of my former commute. You can see this also in the times the journeys started:

There’s a quite clear morning and evening peak: setting out between 10 and 11am, returning from 7pm. The height of the 11am bar shows how bad my timekeeping is in the morning (my ostensible start time is 11.30am). But no real surprises here.
