Marks out of 10?,Would you meet again?
8,"Yes, I’d like to. We have swapped numbers"
7.5,Yes
8,We don’t have any plans to
8,"Yes, although he walked off without my number"
7,"For a great conversation on European culture, perhaps"
9 (perfection doesn’t exist),"I hope so, although we didn’t exchange numbers"
8,I think following each other on Twitter is as committed as this is going to get
6,"Unlikely, but I may follow him on Twitter"
10,I’ve already invited her up to see my etchings
10 for company,"Yes, as friends"
A solid 8,We swapped numbers and have chatted a bit. I hope to meet up again when we’re both free
7,We’ve agreed to. We’ll see!
5,Unlikely
6.5,"Perhaps, as friends"
8.5,"We’ve planned a rendezvous at Horse Meat Disco, but probably just as mates"
8,We’ve arranged a night out as friends
9,We didn’t exchange numbers
8,"Yes, as friends"
8,"To share a couple of £4 pints, sure"
6,"I had a nice time, but some things aren’t meant to be"
8,"Possibly, but solely as cycling buddies"
6.1,"I don’t think so, I’m afraid"
8,"It’s not on the cards; it was a very nice evening, but there was no spark"
A solid 8,We both agreed there wasn’t that spark
Seven,Why not? Rosie would be an interesting person to hang around with now and again
Seven,Yes. I want to get a slice of his Oreo cheesecake
9,As a mate. He was keen for me to teach him some moves from my street dance class
6,I took down her number
7,"Perhaps as friends. He was sweet and interesting and we had a lot in common, but there was no chemistry"
8.9,Yes
Nine,We swapped numbers. I might take him to Harry Potter World or something
7/10,To grab a few pints as mates
8,We plan to meet again and exchanged numbers
8.7,On Tuesday
6,“I like Katie Hopkins – she tells it like it is.”
A very respectable 7,He’s a bit young for me and there was no spark
Nine,Not to hook up but definitely to party
A full 10,"We’ll see, back in London. I’d like to"
8,We’ve decided to stay friends
8,As friends. We exchanged numbers
8,"Yes, but I’m not sure it would be under romantic circumstances"
7,"Absolutely, but as friends"
4. It felt more like a job interview than a date,"As friends, maybe"
9,"Yes, as friends"
7,"Only as friends, because unfortunately there was no spark"
7,"He’s really interesting, but romantically, he is not for me"
A solid 8,I think we both know that probably won’t happen
8. Great conversation,As friends
9,Yes
A solid 9,"Yes, we talked about going to the theatre"
A solid 8,"I think so. I’m not sure about sparks and butterflies, but he’s a lovely guy"
7.5,"He’s a lovely guy, but I think we’re heading down the friends route here"
7.5,It would be good to show her how my headstand is coming along
9,"Yes. I’m not sure if there was a romantic spark, but I like her energy"
7,Sure
8,I’d hope to
7,"I did ask if she’d like to meet again, but I think we both knew it wasn’t going to happen"
6,I don’t think so. There was no connection there for me
7,Maybe as friends
7,"As friends, sure"
"I refuse to grade people, because this isn’t Tinder, but if I had to grade the evening, I’d give it a solid 9",We swapped numbers at the tube station – I would like to see her again
7,"He’s really interesting but, romantically, he’s not for me"
10,"We talked about going to see Anomalisa but not calling it a date. I suspect I’m not quite what Sandra is looking for, and that’s cool. If she becomes a friend, I can’t ask for more"
9,"I hope so, but just as friends"
7,"Romantically, probably not. As friends, definitely"
A solid 8,I’d be delighted to
7.5,I’d like to: we exchanged phone numbers
6,"No, I don’t think so – there wasn’t much of a spark"
8,"Yes, I definitely would. We have swapped numbers, so I guess time will tell"
8,Yes
10. It was so bad it was actually funny,"Well, he took my number"
7.5,Perhaps just for coffee
"10, without a doubt!",Yes – we already have plans to do so
"A solid 7. Really good company, but maybe a bit young for me",We swapped numbers…
7,"I hate to make a judgment based on one blind date, so yes. But if she says no, you’ll change my answer, right?"
8/10,We’ll see
7,"There was no romantic connection, but maybe we’ll catch up as friends"
8,"We discussed meeting in the future – he took my number, so we shall see if he uses it"
An honest 9 disguised as a shy 8,We exchanged numbers. I’d like to see him again
8,Definitely
The date itself? I’d say 8,"Our paths may cross, but I can’t see romance a’bloomin’"
6 for an entertaining evening but the sparks didn’t fly,Probably not
8,We exchanged numbers and said it would be nice to meet up again soon
8,Yes
7. It would have been 8 if he hadn’t been late,"We’ve exchanged numbers, so we’ll see what happens"
"7 – as a teacher I never give full marks, so 70% is a win",Yes. It’s good to see someone in daylight as well as at dusk!
8,I don’t see why not
"6 – not my type, but I had an enjoyable evening","Just as friends, especially if he gets a dog, so I can walk it"
"6, he made me laugh a lot",Not in a romantic scenario
9,We’ll go skating for sure in the future
4. Not for me,"No, but I’d say hello if I bumped into him"
"7 as a person, but about 3 as a date",Not deliberately
8,I would definitely like to
6. It lacked spark,"I don’t think so. Jon’s a lovely guy, but just not right for me"
"I couldn’t reduce Elizabeth to a numeral! But, to conciliate your readership, 10",I would like to
7,It was a friend-zone situation
8,"As friends, yeah"
8,Perhaps as friends. He’s a bit young for me
5,"It’s a “no” from me. I do wish him all the best setting up his retreat in Brazil, though"
9,Sure
4,"We live near one another, so knowing my luck I’ll see him in the street every week"
5. We’re from different worlds,Don’t think so
8,As friends. There was a spark at the beginning but it had fizzled out by the end
7.5,"I hope he’ll become a friend. We got on like a house on fire, but there was no spark"
Cracking chick – 6.5/10,Who’s to say?
7.5,I think so – we exchanged numbers
"7, for a nice evening","Never say never, but I doubt it. Not romantically, anyway"
8,"I don’t know if the chemistry was right for romance, but I’d happily see Kati again"
8.5,"Yeah, why not?"
8.5,I’d like to think so
"Dee is brilliant, dinner with him was a treat – 9!","As friends, but romantically it wasn’t a goer – we are at different stages in our lives"
8,We connected on Facebook
An easy 8.5,"I’d love to, except I failed to get her number"
"6. A great guy, just not for me",Unlikely
8 (I had to take off a couple of points for the canal chat),"Hopefully. I have her number, so we’ll see what happens"
A solid 8,"I gave her my number, but don’t bank on wedding bells. We’d be excellent pub pals"
8,"Yes. Unless she slams me, in which case absolutely not"
7,For professional mentoring. He’s not my type
7,"We didn’t exchange numbers, so I guess no"
7,Most unlikely. We inhabit different planets
7.5,It would be silly not to
8.5,"Yes, we are going to, but just as friends"
A strong 9,"Yes! We’re both away for a few weeks, but plan to when diaries can align"
8,"We’ve swapped numbers, so probably"
7,"Probably not, but I wouldn’t run and hide if I saw him in the street"
6.5,As friends. No romance on the cards
"5. Lovely guy, but no attraction. I even received a couple of yawns at the end",Probably not
8,Yes
"8, but I felt no spark","We lead very different lives, so I can’t see it happening"
"7 – not my cuppa, but nice","Unlikely, but I wish him well"
8.5,"I woke up at 5am with the answer to the brain-teaser she set me before the first course, so I do hope we meet again, to see if I’m right"
6,Possibly not
9,"I’d be happy to on a social level, because we had a lot in common"
4,"No – he’s a nice guy, but there was just no chemistry"
7. Only because I think Alex will go for 7,We said yes. It’s yet to be seen what we meant
7,Sure
10,I have asked her to consider letting me make a picnic so we can have a lovely day out
10 for the right woman,’Fraid not
7,I hope so – she’s supposed to be coming to see me DJ
I’ve only know him one day – I can’t rate him!,If he made me an offer I couldn’t refuse
7,We didn’t exchange numbers but I wouldn’t mind meeting again as friends
6. Lovely girl but there wasn’t much chemistry,Unlikely. I’d prefer someone with a bit more edge to them
9.5,Without doubt – I’m in desperate need of a dating coach
"7 – I liked him, but as a friend",As a mate for a drink
A solid 7,I don’t think it’s on the cards. Maybe we’ll bump into each other at a Björk gig
"6. Nice guy, but no romance","Unlikely, we didn’t swap numbers"
8,I think it’s unlikely
4,Unfortunately not
8.5,He has my number – let’s see
"We agreed to give at least 7, but I had a good time, so 8.5","Yes. Although if she says no, please change my answer"
8,"It turns out we work in the same hospital, so I’m sure we will"
8,I gave her my number
7.5. We may be quite different people. I’d like to find out,"She invited me to an improv night, possibly out of politeness. We’ll see"
"9. I wish I had fancied him, everything else was lovely",I suggested a comedy theatre thing. I hope he doesn’t think I was just being polite
A strong 7,"Yes – only if I could choose the wine, though"
7,I don’t think so. There was no romantic connection
"7.5. A fun evening, but no romantic sparks flew",If he invited me to one of his dinner parties: apparently he’s been known to get a round of applause
"6. It was a smooth-running, slightly above-average date with good company","We didn’t exchange numbers, so I doubt it"
6.5,"Yes, as friends"
10 (because I don’t agree with rating people),Only by accident
Solid (if a little generous) 7,For a casual drink and to continue conversation
"8 or 9, haven’t decided yet",Yes
8.9,"It depends on her review. If it’s positive, then why not?"
5,No
7.4,"Yes, I took her number"
7,We’re planning drinks
7,"Sure, as friends – I suspect however he might not think the same. I gave him my business card, so let’s see"
7,"Honestly, no"
A strong 7,"Yes, I’m sure we could spend another fun evening together as friends"
6,"We didn’t exchange numbers (we never broached the issue), so no"
9,Yes. Already planned
9,For a sober coffee this week
8,Never say never…
7,"As friends, most definitely"
8,Probably
7,"Sure, why not?"
9,"Hmmm, yeah"
For an evening with a stranger: 7,"I sent him a text after two days, as I thought he’d liked me, and what’s to lose? He replied “Hi toots”. My pride was sorely dashed"
7,"We didn’t exchange numbers, so not sure how that would happen"
8,"Yeah, but we didn’t trade numbers"
"Compared with Jude Law, a 4. Compared with some of my exes, a 17. His beard is a 10","We frequent the same comedy club, so I’m sure we will"
7,"In a platonic sense, sure"
7,"As friends, yes. There wasn’t a romantic thing, though"
7,"Alex is a good date, but we lacked spark, so it’s unlikely"
"For the date? 6. For Katie herself, a bit higher!",Maybe in another 10 years?
6,Maybe in another 10 years!
7,"If I ever find myself in his neighbourhood, I’m sure we’d have a nice pint"
8,Yes. Let’s see
8,"I’d be happy to catch up, but we didn’t exchange numbers"
7,Only in the platonic sense
8,"I’m not sure if there was massive romantic chemistry, but I’d hang out with him"
9,For a friendly drink
7 – I know his mum will be reading this,Everyone deserves a second chance
8,We swapped numbers
8,As friends for now – it’s hard to know the potential for a relationship from one meeting
8,"Yeah, I reckon"
8,"As friends, definitely, but not sure if there will be romance"
8,"She was great company, but there was no romance"
8.8,Probably
7,Yes
9,"Yes, we plan to"
8,"Yes, it’s being arranged"
8,"We exchanged numbers, so it’s a possibility"
7,"Yes, as friends"
7. Wonderful company but no real spark,Not in a romantic setting
6,I doubt we will
"6. Josh was a nice guy, but just not my type unfortunately",
5,I’m afraid not
10 out of 10 – I couldn’t have asked for a nicer person,"Sure, I gave her my Facebook"
8. It was a fun evening,"As friends, yeah"
6,We didn’t swap numbers
"As a guy, 8. As a date, 5",By accident
8,"Yes, we got on really well"
9. I’d say 10 but we all need something to work towards,We’ve already been on our second date. It went well
8.5,"Yes, I had a really good time"
9,"Yeah, it would be good. We’ve texted a bit, so we’ll see…"
7.5,"If Mark applied for Britain's Got Talent, I'd happily be in the audience to cheer him on"
7.9,"I suspect not. It was enjoyable, but no sparks flew"
8.26,"We've provisionally agreed to already, though we haven't set a date"
6.2,Unlikely
8 (only because no one is perfect),"Yes, we will probably run into each other, seeing as we live in the same neighbourhood"
9,"Turns out we're neighbours, so it might be hard to avoid each other. But yes"
7,"As friends, yes"
8. He lost 2 for the pebble,Depends what he says
7,As friends
7.7,I don't think so. Unless I need some sailing lessons
9,"Yes, definitely"
9,Depends if he's into inadvertent clowns
8,"Yeah, why not?"
7,Maybe. He could teach me how to play the ukulele
6.5,Probably not
6,"Yes, for friendly drinks"
10,"If she brings her Oyster card, sure"
7,Probably not
Solid 8,"We exchanged numbers, so we'll see"
8,Yes
7,"Perhaps. We have some shared interests, enough for a friendship, not more"
10,"Yes, I have her number"
"8.5. Actually, make it a 9","He asked for my number, ""just in case"". I'm not sure ""in case"" of what, but I'd like to"
8,Perhaps
7,"Sure, why not?"
8,"For a friendly drink, yes"
7.5,Who knows? Maybe
8,"If he asked, yes"
8,"Yes, I'd like that"
7.5,Maybe as friends
7,"He lives round the corner, so we might see each other in Costcutter, but that'd be it"
6.5,"She was nice, but there wasn't the connection for a second date"
5,I'm afraid not
7,Maybe. We certainly had a lot to talk about
10,"Yes, definitely"
8,"Yeah, I think I would"
8+,I don't see why not
9,"If she wants to, definitely"
7,Perhaps
8,Probably not
7,Maybe. If he asked
An 8,As friends. I didn't feel that spark
8,"I suspect she doubts my credentials as a future husband, so probably not"
7.5,I'm writing up Jonny's first speech as an MP
7,I would be very surprised if we met again under any circumstances other than chance
7.5,Maybe if we bump into each other on the dance floor
"He was a terrible, terrible date, but I had a laugh – 6/10",It's possible that I'd bump into him in the neighbourhood
8,I suspect she'd like to watch the semi-final with me
A solid 7,I wouldn't turn and run if I bumped into him
7. A catch for the right person,"I didn't feel a spark. Maybe for a pint, though"
Good company: a powerful 8,It would be a pleasure
"8, maybe 9. I couldn't fault him – he just wasn't my type","Sure, as friends"
7,"I don't think so. He's a very nice guy, but that elusive spark was lacking"
"8 for company, 2 for romance",I'll leave you to work that out
A high 6,"Despite his surname, unfortunately there's no hope for me and Ben"
7,"Yes, to see what she's like on a good day"
A solid 8,I'd happily bump into him again
A solid 8,"I reckon so – I imagine on a friendly basis, though"
7,"Maybe as friends, for power ballad karaoke"
She's a 9,"If reading this hasn't put her off too much, I'd love to"
8,"Unlikely, but I wouldn't rule it out"
7,"It's possible: numbers were exchanged, no plans made"
I'm uncomfortable with judging someone based on one short encounter,"Well, we do share an interest in snowboarding and skiing"
4,"No. He's sweet, but I need someone more interesting"
7,I don't think either of us thought we really hit it off
8,"I gave him my number, so the ball is in his court"
8,"Yes, we exchanged numbers and have already texted each other"
10,Yes
7,When he makes good on his promise to sail me around the world
7,I hope so
I’d rate Phoebe’s company as a 9,I hope so. Is romance on the cards? My instinct says no
8 – it was fun,"No, but I’d suggest coffee if we bumped into each other"
8,I think so
7,As friends
7,Maybe as friends when he is in the country
"A perfect 10. Well, maybe a 9.5",We exchanged numbers
7,I did get a Facebook request…
8,I would quite like to
7,Maybe as friends
8,I don't see why not
"Go on then, I'll give him a 10","Yep, I don't see why not"
10,Yes
7 or 8,"We exchanged numbers, so probably, but just as friends"
7,"Definitely, as a mate"
6,Unlikely
A solid 7,"It was a lovely evening, but…"
"Purely from a compatibility point of view, 7","Yes, as friends. I enjoyed the evening"
We agreed we wouldn't mark each other. But a great guy,As friends. We swapped numbers
8,"Well, he asked for my number, so we'll see"
A strong 7,I've got her number and I'm texting her next week
6.5,We didn't swap numbers
7,"Not romantically, but I'd be very happy to bump into Frances again one day"
8,Touring with my new album would make it hard
7,We swapped numbers
8 or 9,I'd like to
7,"Yes, there's been talk of it"
He was really fun – 8,"We live nearby, so it would be nice to bump into him"
8 – we had a really fun evening,"We got on really well, but for me there wasn't quite the right chemistry"
I don't think the numbers game is appropriate. She was good company,"I don't think we will. Sparks didn't fly, so the search continues…"
A promising 5,"Er, probably not"
A solid 7,I'd be happy to
A solid 7,"Possibly, but possibly not"
"What is this, a baking competition? All I'll say is ""top marks""","He gave me his business card. Maybe he wants to sell me some fish? I'd be up for another date, though"
8.5,I hope so. I'm going to give her a call
7.5,We already have
A good 8,We did: date number two was more relaxed. A third? I don't see why not
I had a fun night and Mo is a hoot; there is no number for that,It was discussed
A solid 8,"We swapped numbers, so it's a possibility"
We scored each other at 8.5 to 9,I'd like to think so
8,Happily
8,I would be happy to
6,"In all seriousness, Alex was a lovely chap, but there was no chemistry between us. So just as friends"
7.75,We agreed it would be nice
7,"Yes, as friends"
"So how does it work? 6 means nice but not again; 7 means yes as friends; 8 means yeah, I fancy her; 9 means I'm desperate; and 10 is just silly? Whatever, I had a good evening and I'd see her again","I did ask if she wanted to come surfing the next day, but she was busy"
7,"Yeah, though I think only as friends"
Is this a school test?,"Yeah, why not?"
9,"Yes, hopefully for a cycle ride some time"
"Giving a mark would ruin a great night. I enjoyed myself and hope she did, too. There's no number for that",It would be a shame not to
8! I had a great night,As friends. But he'd have to venture north of the river
A solid 7,"Maybe, but just as friends"
7.5,We'll see…
A solid 9,We swapped numbers and she's a great girl. It would be good to see her again
9,Yes
"8 – a good evening, but there was no real spark","Yes, I think he would make a good friend"
8,Definitely as friends. It would be good to hang out and go to a gig
"No marking out of 10, but I had a fun night: great company, amazing food, lovely staff","Yes. We spoke about going out for a drink, so we'll see what happens – unless he says I have terrible table manners, in which case I'll hunt him down"
8,Definitely as friends
"I could never judge anybody by a number. Nick was charming, but the spark was not there for me","Certainly, as a friend"
7,"As friends, sure.• Dawn and Nick ate at Wedgwood the Restaurant, Edinburgh. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com"
"I'm less of a numbers person, more of a visual person – I'm holding up the score on my fingers right now",London is a big place
"For some lucky handsome chap, 10/10. Sadly, not for me","We're both big music fans, and said we'll go and see some bands together"
8,"We didn't exchange numbers, so that might be tricky"
7,"As friends, sure"
6.5,No
8,"As friends, definitely"
I'd say a solid 7.5-8,"Yeah, I think we would"
7,"Yes, but I don't think we'd do so in a date scenario"
7,"Yes, but only as friends"
8,Happily
"Oh no, I feel like I'm on Come Dine With Me! 8?",We might catch a Tegan and Sara gig over the summer
8. Really good fun,"Yes. I don't know that we have a romantic future, but as friends for sure"
"7. The spark wasn't there for me, but I can now recommend a bloody great Assam tea","Not in a romantic fashion, but certainly as friends"
8,"We share a lot of interests, so I'm sure we'll bump into each other"
10!,"I suggested that if he wanted some photos of his DJ nights, I would love to shoot them on the house"
You can't give someone a score on being themselves! I had a nice evening,Not romantically
Eek! Something around the 7 mark?,Sure – we laughed a lot
7.5,Happily
Ratings are for misogynists and the unimaginative. I'll give him an 8,I think our bikes are supposed to be hanging out at some point
10,"Yes, it would be nice to go for a drink"
8,I hope so. Maybe when England have the edge on Australia in the Ashes
7,I'd like to. We have exchanged phone numbers
"6 – romantic compatibility was low, but I had a fun evening","Aside from a friendly meet-up, I doubt we'll see each other regularly"
"I'd say 9, but maybe that's a bit too keen, so let's say 8.5","I had a wonderful time, so I do hope so"
"Excellent food and wine, a pretty girl, good conversation – a solid 7.5 (8 if she'd been scouse)",Maybe. It's hard to tell if there's any spark when you know you're appearing in a national paper
A solid 8,"Yeah, he's a nice guy with loads of chat. I was never bored"
8,I don't see why not
Lucy is worth 8. The date probably not more then 6,Yes
"As blind dates in the national press go, it couldn't have gone much better: 9/10",It would be a shame not to
A high 9,I'm quite sure we will
9,"I hope so, for some coffee and people-watching"
11 – he's a fantastic date,Yes – we will meet again as friends
Definitely a 10,"I've invited her to my birthday, so hopefully I'll see her then"
"Bundling the whole experience together, a 9 or a 10",We're due to go to his birthday in a week
7,"I'm trying to persuade him that south London is better than east, so there will be further research opportunities"
8(.33),I want to try her coffee
A respectable 9,Would be fun
8.5,Yes – we've planned to meet again soon
7,"Yes, but probably more as theatre buddies"
A solid 8,We exchanged numbers and agreed to make plans for a theatre outing
5. Cupid definitely had the night off,I'll let you draw your own conclusions
4,No
9 – she's ace,As friends
Between 7 and 8,Yes. I'm the sociable sort
9,Yeah
A solid 9. Nobody's perfect,"Absolutely. After all, a good listener is hard to find"
"Top marks, 10 out of 10",That would be nice
"7. Wait, everyone says 7, I'll say 8",Maybe
8,We swapped numbers…
8,I have texted him…
A solid 7,I doubt it would be on any more than a friendly basis
6,"If we bumped into each other in one of the train stations of south London, I would definitely shake his hand"
5,"Probably not, but only because he said he didn't drink much, and I said I'm not any good at amateur dramatics"
"In honour of the Great London Book Group, and taking the Latin American vibe of the venue for inspiration, I'd say that out of South American countries he was Chile. Numerically, that's 7.5","We didn't make plans but, given shared drinking holes, I'm sure it's only a matter of time till we bump into each other"
7,I'm seeing her for a drink at the theatre in a couple of days
A solid 9,I believe our paths are going to cross again imminently
