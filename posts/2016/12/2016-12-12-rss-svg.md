title: Plot problems in the RSS feed
date: 2016-12-12 11:30

The SVG plots I use seem to be problematic in some RSS readers. Reeder on my phone just displays a white bar, while Reeder on my Mac displays the image properly.

The URLs in the feed are valid and the feed is valid as a whole, so I’m not sure what’s causing this.

If you’ve got any ideas what the problem is, I’d love to hear from you [by email](/about) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/robjwells).
