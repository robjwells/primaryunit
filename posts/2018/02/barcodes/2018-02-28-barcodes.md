Barcodes can be pretty mystifying from the outside, if all you’ve got to go on is a set of lines and numbers, or even a set of magic incantations for the software that produces them.

Despite working at a place where we produce a product with a new barcode every day, I didn’t understand how they were made up for years.

But they’re fairly straightforward, and once you know how they work it’s quite simple to produce them reliably. That’s important because getting a barcode wrong can cause real problems.

### Barcode problems 

In the case we’ll look at here, daily newspapers, an incorrect barcode means serious headaches for your wholesalers and retailers, and you’ll likely and entirely understandably face a penalty charge for them having to handle your broken product.

I know because, well, I’ve been there. In our case at the Star there were two main causes of incorrect barcodes, both down to people choosing:

1.  the wrong issue number or sequence variant;
2.  the wrong barcode file.

We’ll talk about the terminology shortly, but we can see how easily problem number one can occur by looking at the interface of standard barcode-producing software:

</p>

Now, [Agamik BarCoder][agamik] is a nice piece of software. It’s very versatile and produces good-quality images. If you need to make a barcode it’s worth a look.

But look again at that interface — it’s not intuitive what you need to do to increment from the previous day’s barcode, the settings for which are saved in the application. It’s very easy put in the wrong details, or accidentally reuse yesterday’s details.

Second, it produces files with names such as `ISSN 03071758_22_09` — a completely logical name, but the similarity between the names and the fact you have to manually place the file on your page makes it easy to choose the wrong barcode, whose name will likely differ only by one digit to the previous day.

That isn’t helped by Adobe InDesign by default opening the last-used folder when you place an image. At least once, I’ve made the barcode first thing in the morning and accidentally placed the previous day’s barcode file.

One of the suggestions we had after we printed a paper with the wrong barcode was to have the barcode checked twice before the page is sent to the printers. Which is an entirely sensible suggestion, but I know from experience that — however well-intentioned — “check `x` twice” is a rule that can be broken when you’re under pressure and short-staffed.

It’s far more important to have a reliable production process so that whatever makes it through to the proofing stage is highly likely to be correct in any case.

We can understand this by looking at the [hierarchy of hazard controls][hoc], which is useful far outside occupational health and safety:

[hoc]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_hazard_controls

<p>
    <img
        src="/images/2018-02-28-hierarchy-of-controls.png"
        alt="An illustration of the hierarchy of controls, to reduce industry hazards, which has at the top (most effective) the elimination of hazards, followed by substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and then finally (and least effective) personal protective equipment."
        class="no-border"

        height=396
        />
</p>

“Check twice” is clearly an administrative control — changing the way people work while leaving the hazard in place. An engineering control in our case might be to have software check the barcode when the page is about to be sent to the printers (something we do on PDF export by inspecting the filename). We want to aim still higher up the hierarchy, eliminating or substituting the hazard.

But to reach that point we need to understand the components of a barcode.

### Barcode components

Barcodes are used all over the place, so it’s understandable that some terms are opaque. But picking a specific case — daily newspaper barcodes here — it’s quite easy to break down what they mean and why they’re important.

The information here comes from [the barcoding guidance published by the Professional Publishers Association and Association of Newspaper and Magazine Wholesalers][ppa-anmw]. It’s a very clear document and if you’re involved in using barcodes for newspapers or magazines you should read it. (Really, do read it, as while I’ll try to bring newspaper barcodes “to life” below, there’s a lot of information in there that I won’t cover — such as best practice for sizing.)

[ppa-anmw]: http://www.anmw.co.uk/anmw/documents/PPA_Barcode_Guidelines.pdf

Let’s start off by examining a typical newspaper EAN-13+2 barcode, using the terms that you’ll find in the PPA-ANMW guidance:

<p class="full-width">
    <img
        src="/images/2018-02-28-issn-basics.png"
        alt="A diagram showing the components of a British newspaper barcode, using the EAN-13+2 format."
        class="no-border"
        width=720
        height=418
        />
</p>

You’ll see at first that it’s clearly made up of two components: the largest is a typical [EAN-13][] barcode with a smaller [EAN-2][] on the right.

[EAN-13]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number
[EAN-2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EAN-2

Reading left-to-right, we have the [GS1 prefix][gs1] to the barcode number, which is always 977 for the [ISSN numbers][issn] assigned to newspapers and magazines.

[gs1]: https://www.gs1.org/company-prefix

Next is the first seven digits of the publication’s ISSN number — the eighth digit isn’t included because it is a [check digit][] and is redundant because the EAN-13 includes its own check digit.

That check digit follows a two-digit sequence variant, which encodes some information about the periodical. On the right, above the EAN-2, is the issue number. This is used in different ways depending on the publication’s frequency.

Lastly is a chevron, which is used to guard some amount of whitespace on the right-hand side to ensure the barcode reader has enough room to scan properly. (The leading 9 performs the same function on the left.) This is optional.

#### In practice

Now let’s look at a real barcode, see which elements we have to think about, and how they fit together.

<p class="full-width">
    <img
        src="/images/2018-02-28-ms-barcode-annotated.png"
        alt="A diagram showing an annotated barcode as used by the Morning Star newspaper."
        class="no-border"
        width=720
        height=440
        />
</p>

Now let’s start with the elements that were present on the basic ISSN barcpde shown earlier.

##### ISSN number

Your newspaper’s ISSN appears after the 977 prefix. The Morning Star’s ISSN is 0307-1758, but the 8 at the end of that is a check digit, used to detect errors in the preceding seven digits. This is removed because it’s unnecessary as the 13th digit of the EAN-13 is a check digit for all 12 preceding digits. So only the front seven digits of the ISSN appear in the bar code.

##### Sequence variant

For daily newspapers the sequence variant shown earlier provides two pieces of information. The first digit is a price code, which indicates to retailers what price they should charge. The code is dependent on the publication — you can’t tell from the price code itself what price a newspaper will be. For the Star, we currently use price codes 2 (£1) and 4 (£1.50).

The second digit in the sequence variant is the [ISO weekday number][iso-week], and this is true for all daily newspapers using this system. Monday is ISO weekday 1, through to Sunday as 7.

[iso-week]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date

So by looking at the sequence variant in this barcode, we can tell that it’s the paper for Wednesday (ISO weekday 3) and sells at whatever price code 2 corresponds to in the retailer’s point-of-sale system.

When you introduce a new price, typically you use the next unused price code. We recently increased the price of our Saturday paper from £1.20 (price code 3) to £1.50 (price code 4). My understanding is that retailers themselves must be informed of this; your organisation’s circulation manager and wholesalers will be able to provide related information.

##### Issue number

The issue number appears above the EAN-2 supplemental barcode. For daily newspapers this corresponds to the [ISO week][iso-week] containing the edition. Note that this may differ from, say, the week number in your diary. New ISO weeks begin on Monday.

Modern versions of `strftime` accept the `%V` format, which will return a zero-padded ISO week number. In Python the `date` and `datetime` classes have a [`.isocalendar()` method][isocalendar] which returns a 3-tuple of ISO week-numbering year, ISO week number and ISO weekday number.

[isocalendar]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.isocalendar


##### Header strap

The line printed above the barcode is technically not part of the barcode itself, and different publications do different things. It’s common not to print anything, and for years we didn’t either, but I think it’s quite useful to print related information here to help whoever has to check the barcode before the page is sent for printing.

Note that in this example, all the information printed above the barcode is referred to in the barcode itself (except the year). I use this space to “decode” the barcode digits for human readers.

This was suggested to me by our printers (Trinity Mirror), who do something similar with their own titles.

##### Light margin indicator

Eagle-eyed readers will spot that the chevron used to guard whitespace for the barcode scanner is missing from the right-hand side. The PPA/ANMW guidance does urge that you include the chevron, but its absence as such won’t cause scanning problems.
