Barcodes can be pretty mystifying from the outside, if all you’ve got to go on is a set of lines and numbers, or even a set of magic incantations for the software that produces them.

Despite working at a place where we produce a product with a new barcode every day, I didn’t understand how they were made up for years.

But they’re fairly straightforward, and once you know how they work it’s quite simple to produce them reliably. That’s important because getting a barcode wrong can cause real problems.

## Barcode problems 

In the case we’ll look at here, daily newspapers, an incorrect barcode means serious headaches for your wholesalers and retailers, and you’ll likely and entirely understandably face a penalty charge for them having to handle your broken product.

I know because, well, I’ve been there. In our case at the Star there were two main causes of incorrect barcodes, both down to people choosing:

1.  the wrong issue number or sequence variant;
2.  the wrong barcode file.

We’ll talk about the terminology shortly, but we can see how easily problem number one can occur by looking at the interface of standard barcode-producing software:

Now, [Agamik BarCoder][agamik] is a nice piece of software. It’s very versatile and produces good-quality images. If you need to make a barcode it’s worth a look.

But look again at that interface — it’s not intuitive what you need to do to increment from the previous day’s barcode, the settings for which are saved in the application. It’s very easy put in the wrong details, or accidentally reuse yesterday’s details.

Second, it produces files with names such as `ISSN 03071758_22_09` — a completely logical name, but the similarity between the names and the fact you have to manually place the file on your page makes it easy to choose the wrong barcode, whose name will likely differ only by one digit to the previous day.

That isn’t helped by Adobe InDesign by default opening the last-used folder when you place an image. At least once, I’ve made the barcode first thing in the morning and accidentally placed the previous day’s barcode file.

One of the suggestions we had after we printed a paper with the wrong barcode was to have the barcode checked twice before the page is sent to the printers. Which is an entirely sensible suggestion, but I know from experience that — however well-intentioned — “check `x` twice” is a rule that can be broken when you’re under pressure and short-staffed.

It’s far more important to have a reliable production process so that whatever makes it through to the proofing stage is highly likely to be correct in any case.

But to reach that point we need to understand the components of a barcode.
